\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Welcome, young man!\n\n\n\nThis is the Potion Shop! I sell potions\nthat you'll find handy in sticky\nsituations. Want to hear more?\n[1]Sure![2-]Nah.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB0ENo need to be rude. I'm busy too,\nyou know! But you look like such a\nnice boy, so I'll forgive you.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x00If you want some more potent potions,\ngo and talk to my husband. He can mix\nup ingredients to infuse and improve\nthe regular potions I sell here.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Such a smart boy you are! Just stand\nin front of the potion you want to hear\nabout, and press (A).\n\nI'll talk you through everything that\npotion will do for you. The potions I\ncarry are pretty basic.\n\nHowever, if you want something\nwith a bit more kick to it...\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x700You can buy one of my potions and\nwalk it a few steps down to my husband\nthere. He'll be able to help you out.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\x00He might not look like much, but he\nmixes a mean potion, and he's used to\ndealing with kids like you.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0BHmm? Something I can do for you?\n[1]Teach me![2-]Not really.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Hey! You there! Yes, you! The adorable\nboy with the golden hair!\n\n\nWelcome to the Potion Shop! \nYou can drink our potions when you're\ninjured to fill up your hearts.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x700Hey, you're one of those knights,\naren't you? Or one in training,\nat least, hmmm?\n\nLet me tell you, one look at you and\nI can tell you'll need my potions by\nthe cauldron full! So don't try to slink\naway without stocking up.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB06Oh dear\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFCCD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í\n\n\n\nI forgot to ask if you have an Empty\nBottle on you...\n\n\nJust so you know, I can't sell you a \npotion if you don't have an Empty \nBottle to pour it into!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x90BFor some reason, I like you, though, so\nI'll give you a spare Empty Bottle I've\nbeen keeping here in the stall!\nOh, it's nothing. It's my little gift.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700You won't hear me say this often, but\nyou can put other things besides\npotions in an Empty Bottle, so it's a\nuseful thing to carry around!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x70BEmpty Bottles fit in your Adventure\nPouch. Press \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x2CD to take a look.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x2CD
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x70BEmpty Bottles fit in your Adventure\nPouch. Press <g<\x0E\x02\x04\x02\x2CD >>to take a look. \x0E\x01\x11\x02\x2CD\n\n\nHold \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x2CD and tilt the Wii Remote to\nchoose the item you want to use.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x2CD\n\n\nRelease \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x2CD to select that item.\nEasy, right?\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x2CD
If you ever get to the point where you\ncan't fit any more stuff in your pouch\nbecause it's full, you can always drop\nitems off at the Item Check.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\x70BSo what would you like to buy?

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB08Dear, your pouch is full! You're quite\nthe little shopper, aren't you?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xA00Why don't you leave some of your\nthings with that nice Item Check girl?\nThen you won't have to carry all that\njunk around with you!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Here's something that'll put some fire\nin your belly, young man! The new\npotion I've been concocting is finally\nready!\nI call it a <y<Stamina Potion>>!\n\n\n\nIf you drink this up, your stamina\ngauge won't drop as fast as usual!\n\n\nI'll admit it's a bit on the pricey side,\nbut I bet you'll find yourself in a\nsituation where a boost of stamina\nwill make it worthwhile!\nIf you want to buy some, just walk on\nover to the display and take a look!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Boy, have I got the new potion for you!\nI call it...the Air Potion!\n\n\nOne delicious gulp of this elixir and\nyou'll find that while you are\nunderwater, your <b<oxygen gauge>> will\ndrop much more slowly!\nYou'll be like a little fish, young man!\nAnd the price is more than generous,\nif I do say so myself.\n\nIf you're interested in a bottle, young\nman, just examine the blue cauldron,\nand I'll come running!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xA08You don't have an <y<Empty Bottle>>.\nCome back when you've got one,\nyoung man.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB08My dear, you don't have enough\nmoney! You're such a sweet boy, but I\nhave to think of my husband and\nchildren!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xA00Come back and see me when you've\ngot some more pocket money.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x90AThank you, sweetie! If you want a\npotion powered up, go see my husband\nat the end of the counter. He can mix\nsomething up for you.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB10You don't want it, dear? I know some\nof my potions might taste a bit strange,\nbut there's no denying that they do\nwhat's advertised!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xA0EHmph! I don't need window-shoppers\nhere, dear.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01That's a vat of <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02N>>!\nDrink this, dear, and it will replenish\neight hearts.\n\nWhy don't you pick some up for your\nadventure? It's only <r+<20 Rupees>>.\nHow about it?\n[1]Yes, please.[2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x702Hello there!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB00Oh...but before I get into my spiel,\nI should warn you that you need an\nEmpty Bottle to buy anything here. \nUnderstand, dear?\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x700If you want to know more about how\nthings work around here, just ask!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04That's <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02V>>! If you drink that,\nyour <b<oxygen gauge >>will reduce less\nquickly when you're underwater\nfor a short time.\nAre you interested, dear? It's only\n<r+<20 Rupees>>.\n[1]Sure![2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB04Slow down, dear. That potion is not\nquite ready for public consumption yet,\nbut I promise I'll have it out soon!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x700In the meantime, I've got plenty of\nother great potions for you to try out.\nWhy not have a look?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0BNow that amazing concoction is called\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02T>>.\n\n\nDrinking it will make your <b<stamina\ngauge >>decrease more slowly for a\nshort time.\n\nIt's a little pricey but well worth it.\nI'll sell it to you for <r<50 Rupees>>!\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xB04This wonderful potion completely stops\nyour <b<stamina gauge >>from being\ndepleted for a little while.\n\nHowever, I haven't quite perfected\nthe formula, so you'll have to wait until\nit's ready.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x700Please feel free to take a look at my\nother potions, though.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01This mysterious elixir is known as\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02~>>!\n\n\nSimply pour it on a broken shield, and\nin moments the shield will be as good as\nnew! It's amazing!\n\nNot only that, but this multipurpose\nmixture will even restore <r<four>> hearts!\n\n\nHow about some to take on your\ntravels? It's only <r<30 Rupees>>!\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0BThat is a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02A>>.\nThis stuff makes you feel invincible!\nIt's a potion that reduces the damage\nyou take for a little bit of time.\nIf you find yourself facing an opponent\nwho's a little out of your league, this is\nthe potion for you!\n\nThis kind of potion doesn't come cheap\nthough. It's <r<200 Rupees>>. How about it?\n[1]Sure![2-]No, thanks.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nOh, but...you don't have enough\nmaterials to enhance this potion...\n\n\nI'm really sorry, but...maybe you\ncould choose something else?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nOh...dear. This is so uncomfortable\nto say, but...you don't seem to\nhave enough Rupees. I'd love to help\nyou, but...you see...
