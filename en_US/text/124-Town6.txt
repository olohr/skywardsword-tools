Hey there, friend! What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon me, the\ninfamous <b<Moonlight Merchant>>!\n\nDon't ask how I get my wares, 'cause\nI'm not telling!\n\n\nIf there's a rare bauble or two you're\ndying to get your hands on, I might\nknow a stone who knows a stone who\ncan get them for you...for a price!
But...but! Before you go whipping out\nyour Rupees, you should know my\nwares carry a hefty price tag.\n\nPeople who come to me usually don't\nlike collecting treasure on their own,\nor simply can't manage to collect what\nthey need. You sure this is for you?\n[1]Sure![2-]No way.
Excellent! So, tell me, what kind of\ntreasure are you in the market for?\n[1]\x0E\x02\x01\x02®[2]\x0E\x02\x01\x02¯[3]\x0E\x02\x01\x02°[4-]Other.
Something else, huh? Well do any of\nthese pique your interest?\n[1]\x0E\x02\x01\x02¨[2]\x0E\x02\x01\x02­[3]\x0E\x02\x01\x02«[4-]Other.
Sorry, friend, that's all I've got to sell\nright now. If none of those did the trick\nfor you, you'll just have to find what\nyou're after on your own!
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02® it is!\nFor <r<200 Rupees>>, it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02¯ it is! This baby's\nall yours for just <r<200 Rupees>>.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02° coming right\nup! That'll be just <r<200 Rupees>>, friend.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02¨ it is! It's a steal at\njust <r<100 Rupees>>.\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02­ it is!\nFor <r<100 Rupees>> it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
OK, one \x0E\x02\x01\x02« it is!\nFor <r<100 Rupees>> it's all yours!\n[1]Sounds good![2-]Too much.
Fine then. Folks who walk the straight\nand narrow are better off not getting\nmixed up with a shady character like\nmyself anyhow. Know what I'm saying?
Puh-leeeze, I've heard that one before.\nYou say it costs too much. I say you\nprobably didn't want it that much in\nthe first place or you'd cough it up!
And we have a deal! Here's your\nnot-at-all-shady treasure!
Hmm. Looking a little short on funds\nthere, friend. Oh well. When you\nscrape together the Rupees, you know\nI'll be here.
Hopefully your purchase lives up to\nyour expectations, fella! If you get the\nitch to buy some more treasure, you\nknow the stone to talk to.
Hey there, friend! What luck you have!\nYou've just stumbled upon one of th--\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\nOh. You again. You looking to buy\nsome treasure or what?\n[1]Yep![2-]Nah...
So you're looking to buy then, eh?\n[1]Please![2-]Nah...
You're a weird one, climbing all the\nway up here.\n\n\nHey, if you tried to <g<dive>> off the ledge\nhere, I bet you could land in the\nnest on top of the tower down there.\nBut what do I know? I'm a stone.
