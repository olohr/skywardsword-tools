Ancient buildings can be found on\nthe small islands floating in the\narea around <b<Skyloft>>.<b<\n\n>>I calculate over an 80% chance that\nchests will be hidden on such islands.
To the northeast of <b<Skyloft >>there is an\nisland called <b<Bamboo Island>>.\n\n\nAccording to rumors, it is a place\nwhere swordsmen go to test their\nskill in the hopes of winning a reward.
There is rumored to be an insect\nparadise somewhere in the sky.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x386
However, nobody has ever reported\nvisiting such a place.
The knight apprentice known as <b<Strich>>\nis looking for this island and is often\nobserved exploring in the sky.\n\nIt seems that he recently found an\nisland <b<inside the thunderhead >>suitable\nfor insect habitation.
There is an island called <b<Pumpkin\nLanding >>that you can easily spot\nto the southeast of <b<Skyloft>>.\n\nThere you can enjoy the proprietor's\n<y<pumpkin soup >>and also exchange\ninformation with patrons.
There is an island to the southwest of\n<b<Skyloft >>called <b<Fun Fun Island>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x388
Some say that it will be an attraction\nwhere you can obtain a great amount\nof Rupees easily.
It is a place of amusement where you\ncan procure high-value Rupees with\nsurprisingly little exertion.\n\nYou will require room in your wallet to\ncarry Rupees back with you, though,\nso it would be wise to plan accordingly. 
It is a place of amusement where you\ncan procure high-value Rupees with\nsurprisingly little exertion.\n\nMy analysis indicates that you will\nneed to make a payment to play there.
Your Loftwing will pick up speed when\nit descends.\n\n\nMy analysis indicates that if you want\nto reach a destination quickly, you\nshould try to stay in constant descent\nas you travel there.
The <y<pumpkin soup >>from the Lumpy\nPumpkin on <b<Pumpkin Landing >>will cool\ndown in five minutes.\n\nCool pumpkin soup is not as effective\nat restoring hearts. The soup should\nbe consumed while it is still hot.
Loftwings who have mastered the\nadvanced technique of <g<Spiral Charge\n>>can attack from greater distances.\n\nHowever, it is a dangerous technique,\nso it is currently only being taught to\nthe most senior students at the Knight\nAcademy.
To enter <b<Beedle>>'s mobile shop, it seems \nyou need to ring the <r<large bell>>. \x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x38C
Unfortunately, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, you do not have\nthe equipment needed to ring the bell.\nYou need to find <r<something >>that can\nshoot at it from a distance.
The flying shop cannot be observed\nin <b<Skyloft >>after sundown. This leads me\nto infer that it moves to another island\nat night.\n<r<If you were to stay in the airborne shop\nuntil nightfall>>, there is a possibility you\nwill discover where it travels to.
The owner of the Gear Shop in the\nbazaar will buy certain items at night.\n\n\nHowever, he will only buy the\nparticular items he feels like buying\non that day.
The fortune-teller\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02 can divine\ninformation and foresee the location\nyou need to travel to next.\n\nI am not capable of interpreting crystal\nballs or calculating fates, but statistics\nindicate his fortunes operate at over\n90% accuracy.
Various treasures are required to\nupgrade items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nAmong them is a precious treasure\ncalled an <b<Evil Crystal>>. It may be\npossible to obtain one by defeating\na monster that can<r< curse>>.
Various treasures are required to\nupgrade items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nAmong them is the <b<Blue Bird Feather>>,\na particularly precious treasure.\nHopefully it will come as no surprise\nthat it can be obtained from blue birds.
You will need various treasures to\nenhance items at the Scrap Shop.\n\n\nOne of these treasures is called an\n<b<Ornamental Skull>>. It is possible to find\none when you defeat a <b<Bokoblin>>.\n\nIf you are very lucky, you will obtain a\nprecious <b<Golden Skull>>.
The larger your wallet, the more\nRupees you can carry with you.\n\n\nApparently, there is a wallet that can\nhold as many as 9,000 Rupees.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Analysis indicates that you still have\nmuch to learn about the world.\n\n\nPeriodically visiting the fortune-teller\nat the <b<bazaar >>would be an effective\nmethod of remedying this situation.
<b<Beedle>>'s Airshop sells an item called a\n<r<Bug Net >>that will allow you to catch\ninsects.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x394
You can check your <b<map >>to locate\nBeedle's airborne shop. You will need\nto ring the <r<large bell >>hanging from the\nshop to gain access.
To enter <b<Beedle>>'s airborne shop, ring\nthe <r<large bell >>hanging below the\nstructure.\n\nUnfortunately, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, you do not have\nthe equipment needed to ring the bell.\nYou need to find <r<something >>that can\nshoot a projectile from a distance.
The <y<Wooden Shield >>will protect you\nfrom electricity, while the <y<Iron Shield\n>>will protect you from fire attacks.\n\nThe <y<Sacred Shield >>is effective against\nboth of these, and it will also slowly\nrepair itself after taking damage.
There are rumors of a demonic\ncreature being spotted in <b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x396
If you are interested, I recommend\ngoing to the<b< >><b<Lumpy Pumpkin>>, where\nthese rumors appear to have\noriginated.
I now calculate a 95% chance that it is\n<b<Batreaux>> who lives under the shed next\nto the graveyard.
Batreaux would like you to collect\n<y<Gratitude Crystals >>and wants to see\nthem for himself so that he can become\na human.\nIf you aid him in this search, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master,\nthere is an 85% probability that it will\nbenefit you as well.
You collected enough <y<Gratitude\nCrystals>> for Batreaux to become a\nhuman. I estimate a 60% chance that\nthe Skyloft-demon rumor will die.\nBut there is still a 40% probability that\nthe rumor will not fade, based upon the\npossibility that people will still find\nBatreaux's new human face terrifying.
Many houses in <b<Skyloft>> have chimneys\non their roofs.\n\n\nApparently, people regularly go up \n<r<inside the chimneys>> to clean the soot\nfrom them.
Putting <b<medals>> in your pouch will grant\ndifferent beneficial effects on you.\n\n\nAdditionally, rumors exist of a special\nmedal that confers multiple special\neffects to its possessor.

It would seem that people in <b<Skyloft>>\noften accidentally drop precious items\nfrom their floating town to the surface.\n\nI conjecture that returning those items\nto their rightful owners will earn you\ntheir <r<gratitude>>.
If you land a perfect <g<dive >>in Dodoh's\nHigh Dive on <b<Fun Fun Island>>, you will\nwin a very precious item.
The most highly valued Rupee is worth\n300 Rupees.\n\n\nBe aware that picking up an item called\na <r<Rupoor >>will <r<reduce>> the number of\nRupees you have by 10.
Insects can sometimes be found hiding\nunder small jars.\n\n\nYou can locate them by breaking or\nmoving the jars.
There are several platforms in <b<Skyloft>>\nconstructed specifically for mounting\nLoftwings.\n\nIf you fall from a ledge other than one\nof these platforms, a knight guarding\nthe town will think that there has been\nan accident and will come to the rescue.
A knight on night patrol spotted a\n<b<Starry Firefly>> flying over the river\nin <b<Skyloft>>.\n\nSigns indicate that to see a wild Starry\nFirefly for yourself, you must look for\none at night and also possess what\nhumans refer to as \x201Cluck.\"
If you want to pass the time until\nnightfall, you can always sleep in a bed.\n\n\nIt is also possible to replenish hearts by\nsleeping in a bed.
It would seem that the great sky spirit,\n<b<Levias>>, dwells in the clouds near\n<b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3A0
Every year since he was born so long\nago, he has grown larger and larger.\nHe is now the size of a large island.\nHowever, he hasn't been seen recently.
If you get too close to Levias, there is a\ndanger that your Loftwing will collide\nwith one of his fins or his tail.
This is not exactly a rumor, but if you\n<g<focus >>on a target with (Z), and then\npress (v) <r<while still targeting it>>, it is\npossible for me to analyze it.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x7CD\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD
This is not exactly a rumor, but...\n\n\n\nIf you press (1) to open your <r<Gear\nscreen>>, you can read a basic description\nof each item you're carrying.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x4CD\n\nSimply point at the item you want\nmore information on, and press (A).
I recommend that you <g<shield bash>> a\nmonster when it swings a sword or a\nclub at you.\n\nWith your shield up, wait until just\nbefore their swing lands, then <g<shake\nthe Nunchuk>> forward to bash them with\nyour shield.\nIf you are successful, you can cause an\nenemy to become momentarily\nstunned, giving you an excellent\nopening in which to attack.
<g<Hold your >><g<sword straight up >>in the air\nto charge up your sword for a powerful\n<r<Skyward Strike>>.\n\nYou can even charge a Skyward Strike\nwhile you're on the run if you hold the\nsword steadily enough.\n\nIt is also possible to charge up your\nsword while avoiding monster attacks.\nIf you master this technique, it can be\nvery advantageous in battle.
A <g<spin attack>> is a powerful combat\nmaneuver that is executed by swinging\nthe Wii Remote and Nunchuk in the\nsame direction simultaneously.\nSwing your controllers in the intended\ndirection to execute one of four spin\nattacks: up vertical, down vertical,\nleft horizontal, or right horizontal.\nChoose the maneuver you want to\nexecute based on what will be most\neffective.
Some monsters with limited\nintelligence will mistake <y<bombs\n>>for prey.\n\nI suggest you try offering a<y< bomb >>to\na <b<Chuchu>> or <b<Deku Baba >>and see what\nhappens.
Gelatinous <b<Chuchus>> can easily merge\ninto each other to create a bigger,\nmore dangerous monster.\n\nAim your sword strikes to divide their\nbodies and ensure they don't merge\nagain.
<b<Deku Hornets >>will not hesitate to\nattack if you venture near their hive.\n\n\nThey are small and agile, so I calculate\nthe probability of hitting them with\nyour sword at approximately 0%.\n\nI recommend that you run away or\nattempt to <r<capture >>them. Like other\nbugs, they can be taken to the potion\ninfuser and used as raw ingredients.
You may find Rupees if you cut grass\nwith your sword.\n\n\nIf you release a horizontal <r<Skyward\nStrike >>toward a patch of grass, you\ncan slice it more efficiently.
Hitting a mushroom will send spores\ninto the air. <b<Mushroom Spores>> can be\ncollected in an <b<Empty Bottle>>.\n\nGlittering mushrooms produce\nGlittering Spores when struck. When \nthese spores are sprinkled over a heart,\nI project something good will happen.
When you aren't sure of where you \nshould go next, call me with (v) and\ninquire into your <r<current objective>>,\nor alternatively you may ask for a <r<hint>>.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD\nAdditionally, you may find speaking\nwith the <b<fortune-teller>> in Skyloft\nuseful.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Yes, Master.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3AC
Do you recall seeing the <r<mysterious>><r<\ncubes >>bearing the mark of the goddess\nthroughout the land below?\n\nThere seems to be a connection\nbetween those cubes and the locked\nchests in <b<Skyloft>> and the surrounding\nislands.
Technically speaking, this is no rumor,\nbut I will pass on this information\nnonetheless.\n\nWhen energy is released from the\n<r<Goddess Cubes >>scattered across the\nland and it launches into the sky,\nI can calculate its trajectory.\nThen I will note the location in the sky\nthat the energy has returned to on your\nmap, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.
<b<\x0E\x02\x01\x02$ >>have a variety of\nuses.\n\n\nWhile their effects on <b<heart flowers>>\nand <b<Rupees>> are well known, you may\nwant to try sprinkling them on a\nvariety of other items as well.
Using the (B) and \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x2CD Buttons, you\ncan switch items, drink potions, and\nperform other actions while you are\n<r<moving>>.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x2CD\nThis technique is valuable because it\nallows you to perform an action while\nmaintaining a safe distance from your\nenemies.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Yes, Master.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3AF
<b<Bird Feathers>> are a useful material\noften used in equipment upgrades.\n\n\nHowever, there is a 90% probability\nyou will need some kind of tool to\ncatch the birds who provide these\nfeathers.
In ancient times, a great warrior\ndevised a strategy to collect lots of \narrows. Do you know it, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master?\n[1]Tell me![2-]I know it.
The warrior took out his <b<Wooden\nShield >>and approached the Bokoblin\nfort.\n\nHe hid behind his shield as the\nBokoblins rained arrows down on\nhim. He then retreated out of range.\n\nMany arrows <r<were >><r<stuck in his >><r<Wooden\nShield>>. All he needed to do then was\npull them out and fire them back at\nhis enemies with his bow.
You could use a Wooden Shield to\nemploy this same strategy, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\n\nHowever, doing so will damage your\nshield, so <r<pay attention to your\nshield gauge>>.
As you may have observed during your\ntime as one, human beings are not a\nspecies that can stay underwater for\nlong periods of time.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3B0
Somewhere in the world is an item\ncalled a <b<Water Dragon's Scale>>.\nRumors suggest that this item allows\na person to dive deep underwater.
If you return to places you previously\nvisited, you may be able to reach new\nareas using the power of the\n<b<Water Dragon's Scale>>.\nSince you already possess this item,\nyou can easily dive underwater.\n
You may not know this, but human\nbeings are not a species that can\nsurvive in extremely high-temperature \nenvironments.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3B1
There is an item called <b<Fireshield\nEarrings >>in this world somewhere.\nThey allow the wearer to remain in\nareas of extreme heat.
Of course, you already possess the\n<b<Fireshield Earrings>>, so you can freely\nenter extremely hot areas.\n\nI recommend thoroughly exploring\nplaces that were previously too hot\nto travel through safely.
Using <g<sidesteps>> and <g<backflips>> to dodge\nmonster attacks and then quickly\nmounting a counterattack is considered\nan advanced fighting technique.\nTo perform these maneuvers, press and\nhold (Z) to target and while moving \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x8CD\nleft, right, or back, press (A).\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x7CD\n\nThese moves will be particularly\nuseful when your shield is broken.
When you <g<roll >>to bump into a tree or\nwall, objects may become dislodged\nand fall from above.\n\nTo do this move, press and hold (A) to\n<g<dash >>and then <g<shake the Nunchuk >>in\nfront of a tree or wall.
When you find a <r<bird statue>>, you should\nalways examine it more closely, even if\nyou have no intention of using it to save\nyour progress.\nExamining the bird statue will record it\non your map, allowing you to check its\nposition later with \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x3CD.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x3CD
In addition to saving your progress,\n<r<bird statues>> located on the surface\noffer you a way to return to the sky.\n\nHowever, it seems that statues housed\ninside buildings do not possess the\nability to send you back to the sky.
You can climb walls covered in vines,\nbut doing so will slowly deplete your\n<r<stamina gauge>>.\n\nYou can move more quickly when\nclimbing by <g<swinging>> the Wii Remote\nin the direction you want to climb.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3B6
Additionally, <y<Clawshots>> have the\nability to latch on to vines, so you may\nwant to use them in order to reach\nvines from a distance.
While this information does not\ntechnically qualify as a rumor, I feel\nit will be of use to you.\n\nHold down (C) to bring up potential\ntargets to <g<dowse>> for, then select one\nto begin dowsing.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x6CD\n\nYou can search for various items by \nswitching your dowsing target. \n\n\nAlso, if you do not want to dowse for\nanything, you can select Look Around\nto stop dowsing.
On slippery slopes, you may lose your\nfooting and slide down on your\nbackside. Quite gracefully, I'm sure,\nMaster.\nOnce you begin sliding, you will not be\nable to stop, but you can direct your\nslide using \x0E\x02\x04\x02\xECD.
<b<Medals>> will give you various beneficial\neffects as long as you carry them in\nyour pouch.\n\nIf you carry a <b<Heart Medal >>in your\npouch, my analysis indicates you will\nhave a greater chance of finding\na <b<heart>> when you defeat a monster.\nA <b<Rupee Medal>> has a similar effect.\nIt increases the chance you will find\nRupees when you defeat a foe.\n\nSeveral other types of medals are\nknown to exist.
Medals will grant you various\nbeneficial effects as long as you\ncarry them in your pouch.\n\nA <b<Potion Medal>> will increase the\nduration of the effects of certain\npotions, such as <y<Stamina Potions>>.\n\nAdditionally, several other types of\nmedals are known to exist.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Yes, Master.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x3BB
You possess sufficient arm strength to\nslice your sword through the trunks of\nsmaller trees.\n\nIf a point on a tree appears to glow,\ncut through that spot with your\nsword and you may be rewarded with\na Rupee.
Any <b<\x0E\x02\x01\x02\x07s >>that don't hit their\ntarget can be picked up and reused.
I conjecture this information will be\nof use to you.\n\n\nPress (2) to read information about the\nactions immediately available to you.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x5CD\n\n\nBy doing this, you may learn of new\nactions that you can perform.
When you want to hang down from an\nedge or cliff without jumping, press\n(A) to <g<hang down>>.\n\nUse \x0E\x02\x04\x02\xECD to move along the ledge while\nyou are hanging.
You can fill an <b<Empty Bottle>> with many\nthings, such as potions, water from\nstreams, <b<Mushroom Spores>>, and\n<b<pumpkin soup>>.\nEmpty Bottles can even be used to\ncatch <b<Fairies>>.
While not technically a rumor, I am\nsure the information I am about to\nrelay to you will prove useful.\n\nWhile targeting an object or character\nwith (Z), you can press (v) to hear my\nanalysis of the targeted subject.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x7CD\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD\n\nI calculate a 60% chance that a portion\nof the information contained in my\nanalysis will be new to you.





When you require my analysis of a\n<g<target>>, press (v) <r<while targeting it\n>>with (Z).\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x7CD\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD
