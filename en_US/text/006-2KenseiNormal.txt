To search for <b<Zelda>>, I recommend you\n<g<dive>> into the <r<column of light >>in the\nclouds and fall to the ground below.\n\nThe column of light is to the south of\n<b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Search the surface and look for clues\nto ascertain <b<Zelda>>'s whereabouts as\nquickly as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06É
I've detected remnants of civilization\nhere on the surface. I advise you to\nfirst explore the area near where you\ntouched down.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I recommend you follow the advice of\nthe old woman at the <b<Sealed Temple \n>>and head to <b<Faron Woods>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
<b<Zelda>> is alive, but she has moved to\nanother location. You must expedite\nyour search for her.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06Ê
Zelda is likely to be perceived as a\nconspicuous character in these woods.\nConfer with local life-forms to see if\nthey know her whereabouts.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on information received from\nthe Kikwi <b<Machi>>, there is an 80%\nchance that finding the Kikwi elder\nwill aid our search for Zelda.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
If we can locate all of the Kikwis\nscattered throughout the area, it is\nlikely the elder Kikwi will be able to\nprovide helpful information.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I recommend that you climb onto\n<b<Bucha>>'s back and take the Kikwi\nheirloom.
Based on oral reports from the Kikwis\nwe have encountered, I calculate a\n95% chance that <b<Zelda>> headed to the\ntemple located deep in <b<Faron Woods>>.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I advise that you travel to that\nlocation as quickly as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is an 85% probability that Zelda\ncurrently resides in <b<Skyview\nTemple >>located in the northeastern\narea of <b<Faron Woods>>.\nI anticipate the temple will be occupied\nby a large number of monsters. You\nmust locate Zelda as fast as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue within <b<Skyview Temple>>,\nthere is a 97% chance <b<Zelda>> has\nheaded for <r<Eldin Province>>.\nI advise you to take the tablet you just\nacquired and place it in the <r<altar\n>>housed within the <b<Statue of the\nGoddess >>in <b<Skyloft>>.\nDoing so should result in the creation\nof a new column of light through which\nyou can access Eldin Province.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue within <b<Skyview Temple>>,\nthere is a 97% chance <b<Zelda>> has\nheaded for <r<Eldin Province>>.\nI recommend <g<diving>> into the <r<column\nof light >>that leads to the Eldin\nProvince.\n\nThe column of light you seek is\npositioned to the north of <b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on the song from the goddess\nstatue heard within <b<Skyview Temple>>,\nthere is a 90% probability that <b<Zelda>> is \nnow in <b<Eldin Province>>.\nTo ascertain Zelda's whereabouts as\nquickly as possible, it will be most\neffective to look for local life-forms\nwho may have seen her pass by.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Judging by the discussions of the\nMogmas you met on <b<Eldin Volcano>>,\nI infer that <b<Zelda>> has been taken by\na monster to a temple on the volcano.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06Ð
You are currently looking for the <r<key\nto open the temple door>>. This key\nhas been split into five pieces which can\nbe located with your <g<dowsing>> ability.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
You have reassembled the key to the\ntemple on Eldin Volcano, and you are\nheaded there to open its door.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on information from the\nMogmas, I infer that <b<Zelda>> has been\nabducted by a monster and is currently\nin the <b<Earth Temple>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06Ñ
The probability of recovering Zelda\nunharmed is decreasing rapidly.\nYou must find her as soon as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Unfortunately, she has now been led\naway by an unknown individual and\nhas already moved to another area.\n\nAs you did at <b<Skyview Spring>>,\nI recommend seeking guidance from\nthe goddess statue located within\nthe <b<Earth Spring>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the <b<Earth\nTemple>>, there is a 90% probability that\n<b<Zelda>> has headed to <r<Lanayru Province>>.\nI advise you to take the <r<tablet >>you just\nacquired and place it in the <r<altar\n>>housed within the <b<Statue of the\nGoddess >>in <b<Skyloft>>.<b< \n>>Doing so should bring forth a new\ncolumn of light through which you can\naccess Lanayru Province.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the <b<Earth\nTemple>>, there is a 90% probability that\n<b<Zelda>> has headed to <r<Lanayru Province>>.\nI recommend <g<diving>> into the <r<column\nof light >>that leads down to Lanayru\nProvince.\n\nThe column of light you seek is\npositioned to the southwest of <b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on information from the\ngoddess statue within the <b<Earth\nTemple>>, there is a 90% probability that\n<b<Zelda>> has headed to <r<Lanayru Province>>.\nTo ascertain Zelda's whereabouts as\nquickly as possible, it will be most\neffective to look for local life-forms\nwho may have seen her pass by.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
You are currently searching for the\nentrance to <b<Lanayru Mining Facility >>so\nthat you can reach the <r<Temple of Time>>,\nwhere <b<Zelda>> is currently located.\nI recommend utilizing your map\nwhile in <b<Lanayru Desert >>to ascertain\nthe position of the mining facility.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is an 85% probability that <b<Zelda\n>>has headed to the <b<Temple of Time >>in\nthe western region of <b<Lanayru Desert>>.\n\nHer objective is currently unknown,\nbut I recommend that you hurry to the\nTemple of Time as well, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nAs the temple gate is currently\nunusable, the only way into the temple\nis through <b<Lanayru Mining Facility>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Based on what the unidentified person\nwith <b<Zelda >>in the <b<Temple of Time >>said,\nspeaking with the old woman in the\nSealed Grounds may aid your search.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach Zelda, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nEvidence suggests the Ballad of the\nGoddess, which has been known in\n<b<Skyloft >>for generations, may hold a\nclue to the location of these flames.\nAnalysis indicates your best course of\naction is to search Skyloft and learn\nwhat you can of this song.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
The lyrics of the Ballad of the Goddess\nthat you heard from <b<Gaepora>> mention\ndirecting the <r<two great whirling sails\ntoward the Light Tower>>.\nThat tower stands in <b<Skyloft>>'s plaza.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06Ù
Although the meaning of this phrase is\nunclear, I recommend that you search\naround Skyloft for two things that\ncould be construed as whirling sails.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Although a connection with the two\nsails is not 100% certain, it is clear that\na <r<propeller >>from a Skyloft windmill\nhas fallen below the clouds.\nI recommend you look for a way to\nretrieve this propeller.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Although a connection with the two\nsails is not 100% certain, it is clear that\na <r<propeller >>from a Skyloft windmill\nhas fallen below the clouds.\nIt is possible to locate the propeller\nusing your <g<dowsing >>ability.\n\n\nOnce you have located it, you can\nget the robot you reactivated in the\nScrap Shop to carry it back to\nSkyloft for you.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is an 80% chance that one of\nthe <r<two whirling sails>> we seek is the\nwindmill repaired by <b<Jakamar>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Although a connection with the two\nsails is uncertain, there is an 85%\nchance that the object you just found\nis a <r<propeller>> from a Skyloft windmill.\nI recommend guiding the robot from\nthe Scrap Shop back to Skyloft while\nhe carries the alleged propeller.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
By rotating the windmills to face the\nLight Tower, you have revealed a\nstructure hidden atop the tower.\nI advise you to investigate it.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
The Light Tower situated in the Skyloft\nplaza currently projects a powerful\nbeam of light into the distance toward\na fixed point.\nI have determined with 80% certainty\nthat the secrets alluded to within the\nBallad of the Goddess are hidden at the\npoint where that light is focused.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo accomplish this, I recommend you\nuse your <g<dowsing>> ability to locate the\nplace in <b<Faron Woods >>that responds to\nthe guiding song of <r<Farore's Courage>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nIf you use the <b<Water Dragon's Scale \n>>from the <r<trial>> in <b<Faron Woods>>, there is\na 90% chance you will be able to reach\na new area in <b<Faron Province>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
According to the Kikwi hermit, <b<Yerbal>>,\nthe <b<Water Dragon>> guards a <r<sacred\nflame >>that will enhance your sword.\n\nYou require more information on the\nflame. To obtain it, you will need to\nspeak with the Water Dragon who\nresides at the bottom of the lake.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06Þ
To learn the location of the sacred\nflame in <b<Faron Province>>, you must find\n<y<sacred water>> for the Water Dragon.\n\nI have registered the sacred water as\na target you can now search for using\nyour <g<dowsing >>ability.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
The entrance to the place that holds\n<r<Farore's Flame>>, one of the sacred\nflames, has been opened by the\nWater Dragon.\nIt is very likely that a great number of\nmonsters infest this place, so I highly\nrecommend you equip yourself\nproperly for a hostile environment.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThe Water Dragon stated that <r<Farore's\nFlame>>, one of the sacred flames, can be\nfound in the <b<Ancient Cistern>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Now that a sacred flame has enhanced\nyour sword, I estimate a 90% chance\nthat returning to the <b<Isle of Songs>> will\nyield new guidance from the goddess.\nI recommend you follow the beam of\nlight being projected from the Light\nTower back into the <b<thunderhead>> and\nreturn to the Isle of Songs.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo obtain the sacred gift that will\nenable you to find the second sacred\nflame, I recommend you head for the\n<r<trial>> in <b<Lanayru Desert>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06â
There is a 96% chance that you can \nreach new locations within <b<Lanayru\nProvince>> using the <y<Clawshots>> you got\nfrom the <r<trial >>in the <b<Lanayru Desert>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Using the <y<Clawshots>>, you have managed\nto enter the <b<Lanayru Sand Sea>>.\nI suggest you search the area for\nclues leading to the next sacred flame.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
It would seem pirates have stolen the\nvessel of a robot captain in the <b<Lanayru\nSand Sea>>. The <r<sacred flame>> you seek is\nalso on board.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ã
To take back the ship, you will first\nneed to travel to <b<Skipper's Retreat>>\nand obtain a sea chart.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I advise you to take the sea chart\nyou've obtained back to the robot\ncaptain.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Your current objective is to search\nthe <b<Lanayru Sand Sea >>for the ship\nthat is said to contain the next <r<sacred\nflame >>that will enhance your sword.\nAccording to the skipper of this stolen\nship, there is a good chance you can\nacquire information about the ship\nat the Lanayru <b<Shipyard>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Your current objective is to search\nthe <b<Lanayru Sand Sea >>for the ship\nthat is said to contain the next <r<sacred\nflame >>that will enhance your sword.\nAccording to the skipper of this stolen\nship, you may find information on the \nwhereabouts of this vessel at the\n<b<Pirate Stronghold>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Your current objective is to search\nthe <b<Lanayru Sand Sea >>for the ship\nthat is said to contain the next <r<sacred\nflame >>that will enhance your sword.\nI estimate an 85% chance that the\nvessel you seek sails the sand sea.\nUse your <g<dowsing>> ability to locate and\npursue this ship.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThe likelihood of the second sacred\nflame being housed in the <r<Sandship>>\nthat sails the <b<Lanayru Sand Sea>> is 95%.\n\nI advise you to search the interior\ncompartments of the vessel for the\nsacred flame.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Now that a sacred flame has enhanced\nyour sword, I estimate a 90% chance\nthat returning to the <b<Isle of Songs>> will\nyield new guidance from the goddess.\nI recommend you follow the beam of\nlight being projected from the Light\nTower back into the <b<thunderhead>> and\nreturn to the Isle of Songs.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nTo obtain the sacred gift that will\nenable you to find the third sacred\nflame, I suggest you seek out the <r<trial\n>>on <b<Eldin Volcano>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThere is a 95% chance that you can \nreach new areas within <b<Eldin Province\n>>using the <b<Fireshield Earrings >>you got\nfrom the <r<trial >>on <b<Eldin Volcano>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Your current objective is to search\nEldin Province for the third sacred\nflame that will enhance your sword.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this\nflame is housed in the large structure\nyou discovered, but the entrance is\nblocked by a wall of flames.\nBased on my projections, in order to\nextinguish the fire you will need a large\namount of <r<water>> and a <r<vessel>> in which\nto transport it.\nYou should focus your efforts on\nsecuring these items.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
You are currently searching for the\n<r<sacred flame >>that will enhance your\nsword.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ì
To extinguish the wall of fire blocking\nyour path beyond the summit, you need\nto transport the giant <r<water basin >>used\nby the Water Dragon.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I've confirmed a very large structure\npositioned atop the volcano's summit.\nI recommend you explore it.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
To reach <b<Zelda>>, you must enhance your\nsword using the <r<sacred flames >>of the\nthree provinces.\n\nThere is a 95% probability that the\nthird sacred flame is located inside the\nsanctuary at the summit of <b<Eldin\nVolcano>>. I recommend you search it.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is a 95% probability that the \n<r<Gate of Time>> in the <b<Sealed Temple>>\nwill lead to <b<Zelda>>'s current location.\n\nI recommend you activate the Gate of\nTime using the power of your newly\nenhanced sword.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
At present, your most urgent priority is\nsealing away the unidentified monster\nthat is attempting to rouse itself.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
The giant monster that appeared in\nthe <b<Sealed Grounds >>has been\ndriven back into captivity again.\n\nMy assessment is that this creature\nposes no additional threat for the\nmoment.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ð
The time has finally come to awaken\nthe <r<Gate of Time >>using the power of\nyour enhanced sword. I suggest you\nmake this your immediate priority.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, you have now passed through\nthe <r<Gate of Time>>.\n\n\nProceed forward. I calculate a 99%\nprobability that <b<Zelda >>waits just ahead.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01To achieve your destiny and keep the\npromise you made to Zelda, you must\nvanquish <b<Demise>>. \n\nTo accomplish this task, you will need\nto find and obtain the <y+<Triforce>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Master, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02you must now find the <y+<Triforce>>\nin order to vanquish <b<Demise>>.\n\n\nI strongly recommend that you search\nfor information about the <y+<Triforce>>\nwithin <b<Skyloft>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is an 80% probability that you\ncan get information about the <y+<Triforce\n>>from <b<Levias>>, the great spirit of the\nskies.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ó
<b<Instructor Owlan >>knows a great deal\nabout Levias. I recommend that you\nask him for more information about\nthis great spirit.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
However, in order to aid Levias,\nyou will need to learn the <g<Spiral\nCharge >>flight maneuver from\n<b<Instructor Owlan>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
There is an 80% probability that you\ncan get information about the <y+<Triforce\n>>from <b<Levias>>, the great spirit of the\nskies.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ô
There is an 85% chance that talking\nwith the owner of the Lumpy Pumpkin\nwill yield information that will aid\nyour search for Levias.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I calculate a 90% chance that <b<Levias\n>>will appear if you take him an\noffering of the <y<pumpkin soup >>he\nenjoys consuming.\nTo this end, I suggest you take the\npumpkin soup to the small island with\nthe <r<rainbow>> inside the <b<thunderhead>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
However, Levias is behaving in a highly\naggressive manner. It is impossible to\ntalk with him in this state.\n\nI suggest you utilize the Spiral Charge\nto dislodge the foreign objects\nattached to him.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
In order to acquire the <y+<Triforce>>, the\npower that will allow you to vanquish\n<b<Demise>>, you must first complete the\nSong of the Hero.\nYour urgent task is to learn the\ndifferent parts of the song from the\nthree dragons who preside over the\nthree different provinces of the land.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
In order to acquire the <y+<Triforce>>, you\nmust first meet with the three dragons\nof the land and complete the <r<Song of\nthe Hero>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ø
In order to acquire the <y+<Triforce>>, you\nmust first meet with the three dragons\nof the land and complete the <r<Song of\nthe <r<Hero<r<>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ø
In order to acquire the <y+<Triforce>>, you\nmust first meet with the three dragons\nof the land and complete the <r<Song of\nthe <r<<r<Hero<r<<r<>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ø

You have learned two parts of the <r<Song\nof the <r<<r<Hero<r<<r<>>. Your next move should be\nto seek out the dragon who rules over\n<b<Lanayru Province>> as fast as possible.\n[1]And after that?[2-]Got it.
You have learned two parts of the <r<Song\nof the <r<<r<Hero<r<<r<>>. Your next move should be\nto seek out the dragon who rules over\n<b<Eldin Province>> as fast as possible.\n[1]And after that?[2-]Got it.

When you have collected three parts\nof the Song of the Hero, return to\nthe great sky spirit, <b<Levias>>, and\ncomplete the Song of the Hero.\nIf the information you've gathered is\naccurate, doing this will open the path\nto the <y+<Triforce>>.\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe <y+<Triforce>>, you must use its power to\nvanquish <b<Demise>>.\n\nThis is not only your ultimate goal but\nalso your destiny, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
You have learned the three parts of the\nSong of the Hero guarded by the\ndragons who reside on the surface.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06ù
I recommend returning to <b<Levias>>, the \ngreat sky spirit, to hear the final part\nand complete the Song of the Hero.\n[1]And after that?[2-]Got it.
I infer the completed Song of the\nHero will open a path to the Triforce.\n\n\nShould you go on to successfully obtain\nthe <y+<Triforce>>, you must use its power to\nvanquish <b<Demise>>.\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02 \n\nDoing so is your ultimate goal and your\ndestiny, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.
You are currently searching for the\n<y+<Triforce>>, which has the power to\nvanquish <b<Demise>>.\n\nUtilize your <g<dowsing>> ability with the\n<r<Song of the Hero >>to find the fourth\n<r<Trial Gate>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, the <r<\x0E\x02\x01\x02´ >>you\nreceived on completion of the final\ntrial is part of a pair.\n\nI infer that the matching second stone\nis somewhere within Skyloft. There is a\n90% chance that finding this stone will\nget you one step closer to the <y+<Triforce>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
<b<Ghirahim>> has abducted Zelda and fled\ninto the past with her. You must chase\nafter him as quickly as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
<b<Ghirahim>> has abducted Zelda and fled\ninto the past with her. You must chase\nafter Zelda as quickly as possible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
<b<Ghirahim>> has used the power of <b<Zelda>>'s\nsoul to revive <b<Demise>>. I'm afraid\nto report that further analysis of the\nsituation is impossible.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
<b<Demise>> has once again broken the\nseal that binds him in an attempt to\nfree himself and return to full power.\n\nIf you fail to beat back this monster\nand gain more time to search for the\nTriforce, I estimate you have less than\na 1% chance of completing your quest.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I project that the soil in <b<Lanayru\nProvince>> will not provide enough\nnourishment for the Life Tree\nSeedling to grow and produce <r<fruit>>. \nIn order to obtain this fruit, which the\nThunder Dragon seeks, you must find a\nplace to plant it where the tree can\ngrow strong <r<over many long years>>.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I recommend you take the\n<r<Life Tree Fruit >>to the Thunder Dragon\nin <b<Lanayru Province>>. \n\nI project a 90% chance that the\nThunder Dragon will agree to teach\nyou his <r<part of the Song of the Hero\n>>if the fruit restores him to health.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, your primary objective is to\ndefeat the enemy here and overcome\nthe grueling task the Thunder Dragon,\n<b<Lanayru>>, has set before you.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
You are currently searching for a \n<r<sacred flame >>in <b<Eldin Province >>that \nwill enhance and augment your sword.\n\nYou have found a structure that is\nhighly likely to contain the sacred\nflame, but the entrance is blocked\nby a wall of flame.\nThere is an 80% chance that you will\nneed the Water Dragon's <r<tub >>to\nsuccessfully extinguish the flames.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Although details are currently unclear,\nI have detected a massive disturbance\nin the vicinity of the great pit in the \n<b<Sealed Grounds>>.\nYou must carry out the task the old\nwoman has asked of you and deal\nwith it.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I calculate a 99% probability that the\n<y+<Triforce >>is somewhere in the structure\nthat appeared at the base of the Isle of\nthe Goddess.\nThe <y+<Triforce >>has power capable of\nvanquishing <b<Demise>>. I recommend a\nthorough exploration of this\nstructure's interior areas.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
Current Session Play Time: <r<\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x00\x2CD\xFF1A\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x01\x2CD>>\nTotal Play Time: <r<<r<\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x02\x2CD<r<\xFF1A\x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x03\x2CD>>\nThis concludes my analysis.
<b<Zelda>>'s presence seems to have\nvanished. I recommend a sweep \nof the area.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x128
I lack the data required to perform an\naccurate analysis of the current\nsituation.
