Want to know why I'm on a bicycle?\n[1]Yeah, why?[2-]Not really.
\x0E\x01\x07\x04\x00\x15Aren't you a curious one!\n\n\n\nI pedal this bike to generate enough\nelectricity to keep this place in the air!\nPlus, all this pedaling has got me in\nfantastic shape!\nYep, I'd say my lifestyle is pretty\n<b<ecofriendly>>! But, uh...with you on\nboard, there's plenty of extra weight,\nso I have to pedal as hard as I can...
Fine, then. Just don't break my\nconcentration!\n\n\nWith you on board, I have to pedal as\nhard as I can because of all the\nEXTRA WEIGHT...
Oh, sorry! \x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍI don't mean to be rude!\nPlease have a look around. I've got\nall kinds of great stuff!

Oh, hello! I'm so glad to see you back\nat Beedle's Airshop! Let me know\nif you're interested in any of my items.
Ah! Welcome!\n\n\n\nWhat?! You found something?!\nIf I try to talk about it now, we\nmight crash...\n\nWhy don't we talk later this evening?\nYou can rest on that bed over there\nuntil it's night.
Oh! Welcome, customer...\n\n\n\nPlease, help me! My <b<Horned Colossus\nBeetle >>is missing!\n\n\nIt may look like it takes everything\nI've got to keep this place afloat, but I\ncan't get the thought of my poor lost\nbeetle out of my head!

We can talk tonight.
Oh! If you want, you can take a nap\non the bed over there. We can talk\ntonight when I can stop pedaling!
