You are currently located in <b<Sky Keep>>.\nThe pathway here is too narrow\nto dodge enemy attacks.\n\nI recommend making good use of your\n<g<shield bash>>, as I project it will be\ndifficult to find heart-replenishment\nopportunities.
You are located inside <b<Sky Keep>>.\nNo monsters exist here, though I infer\nexploring this area will not be easy.\n\nTo aid you, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I will increase\nanalytical granularity and provide\n<r<situational analysis for each section>>.

My projections indicate that equipping\na sword is sufficient for combat at\nthis location.\n\nYou could also consider stocking your\npouch with helpful items.
You are sufficiently equipped to\nexplore this area. You can safely swap\na portion of the combat-oriented pouch\nitems for other support pouch items.
In the bazaar, you can use Rupees\nand treasures dropped by defeated\nmonsters to buy and upgrade items.
Pouch items that focus on heart\nreplenishment are unnecessary in this\narea. I recommend removing non-\ncombat pouch items.
Be prepared to engage monsters that\nattack in hordes.
Use of your limited supply of pouch\nitems should be avoided when possible.
Certain monsters will drop treasure\nupon defeat, but I would discourage\nyou from taking any unnecessary risks\nwhen seeking treasure in this fashion.
There is little here that will put your\nlife in danger. I recommend using this\nopportunity to sharpen your sword\ntechniques in smaller battles.
The structure of this enclosed space\nwill hamper the speed with which you\ndiscover monsters, increasing the\nchance of unexpected damage to 75%.\nI recommend keeping a large quantity\nof potions with you.
Your life should not be in danger as\nlong as you avoid engaging multiple\nenemies in combat.
Your current selection of pouch items\ndoes not sufficiently protect you.\nI recommend carrying defensive and\nhealth-replenishing pouch items.
My projections indicate the danger to\nyour life will be limited if you remain\ncalm and engage monsters confidently.\n\nUse your health-replenishing items\nsparingly.
Use of weapons and items is not\npossible underwater. You must\nprotect yourself by other means.
Analysis indicates use of your current\nselection of items will be limited due to\nthe large sections of this area that\nare underwater.

You are somewhat prepared for this\narea, but due to the presence of air,\nland, and aquatic enemies, I suggest\nyou exercise caution.
You will not be able to use items and\nweapons while underwater. Search for\nother ways to defend yourself.
I recommend keeping <y<Air Potions>>\nor <y<Heart Potions>> handy in case of\noxygen depletion and any resulting\nheart loss.

I project a high probability that you\nwill sustain damage from both\nmonsters and magma.\n\nI recommend carrying recovery and\ndefensive items in your pouch.
With your current selection of items,\nI estimate an 85% chance of serious\nhealth loss before finding treasure or\nRupees.
There is minimal danger when you\nare set on fire by an enemy attack,\nprovided you react calmly and quickly.
You will continue to take damage while\nyour clothing is on fire. I recommend\ncarrying plenty of recovery items in\nyour pouch.
Even minor injuries can become life\nthreatening if you sustain enough of\nthem. Remain cautious.
It would be dangerous to continue\nexploring this area with your current\npouch items. I recommend you carry\nrecovery and defensive pouch items.

The layout of the sanctuary is quite\ncomplex. It will be less dangerous to\nexplore in stages, frequently returning\nto <b<Skyloft>> to rest and resupply.
My projections indicate you may have\ndifficulty fighting with the pouch\nitems you are carrying.\n\nI highly recommend that you save\nyour progress whenever you encounter\na <r<bird statue>>.
You are equipped to handle the loss of\na few hearts, but you must remain\ncautious. There are a large number\nof strong foes in the area.
It is possible to attack <b<Bokoblins>>\npositioned on towers and high ground\nusing your <r<bow>> and <r<bombs>>.\n\nYour chance of a successful attack is\nhigher if you strike before you are\nnoticed.
<b<Bokoblins>> are constructing a fortress\non high ground. I recommend\nemploying weapons with\nlong-range attack capability.
You are carrying mostly noncombat\nitems in your pouch, so I currently\nproject a 65% probability that you will\nencounter difficult combat conditions.\nI recommend making sure you are\nfully equipped to handle long-range\nattack capability.
Most of the enemies in this area are\n<b<Bokoblins>>, so I project you are in\nlittle danger of running out of hearts.\n\nAttack is the best defense here.
Monsters can appear without warning.\nYou will need to be ready to switch\nbetween your sword and other\nweapons at a moment's notice.
<b<Lanayru Province>>, our current\nlocation, is vast in size. I recommend\ncareful rationing of items that do\nnot regenerate themselves.
You are not well suited to this\nenvironment. I recommend avoiding\nunnecessary combat.
Your gear is suitable for this vast\ndesert environment. You should be\nable to explore relatively safely.
There are many monsters in this area\nthat can attack from a distance.\nBe prepared to lose hearts.
You are equipped to adapt to a\nvariety of circumstances.\n\n\nHowever, the possibility of trouble\nwill increase if you alter your current\nbalance of pouch items.
Because of the significant number of\npowerful enemies in the area, I highly\nrecommend carrying pouch items that\nfocus on recovery and defense.
You are carrying a number of\npouch items that are ineffective in\nbattle. This may lead to the unplanned\nconsumption of recovery pouch items.
It will be difficult to explore the vast\n<b<Lanayru Sand Sea >>with only combat-\nfocused items in your pouch.\n\nYou'll need to take measures to\npreserve and recover hearts when\nnecessary.
Your preparations for preserving and\nrecovering hearts are insufficient. If\nyou want to proceed as is, be cautious\nin both exploration and combat.
The <b<Lanayru Sand Sea>> is quite vast.\nI recommend prioritizing equipment\nthat will help preserve and recover\nhearts.
Your gear is more suited to this area\nthan other types. Prioritize heart\npreservation when exploring the\n<b<<b<Lanayru<b< Sand Sea>>.
The inside of the ship features many\nsmall rooms and corridors. Close\ncombat is expected, so take equipment\nthat mitigates heart depletion.
Your pouch-item loadout can adapt\nwell to many scenarios, but you can\nincrease suitability by 10% by adding\ndamage-mitigating pouch items.
The inside of the ship has narrow\ncorridors where combat cannot be\navoided. I project you will lose a\nnumber of hearts in this area.
Your pouch items correctly focus on\ndefense and recovery. Be aware, \nthough, that close combat will likely be\nunavoidable in the ship's corridors.
Analysis shows close combat will\nbe frequent here. Equipment suited to\nlong-range combat will be ineffective.\nYou will need hearts for the assault.
My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.
My projections indicate you are likely\nto be injured in combat because you\nwill be traversing a number of narrow\nplatforms here.\nI recommend carrying pouch items that\nare ideal for defense and heart\nrecovery.

You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Carry\nhealth-recovery pouch items.

You could be ambushed by fire-arrow-\nshooting monsters at any time.\nI suggest using items that allow you\nto deal swiftly with these monsters.
You have a high probability of\nsustaining injury when you approach\nmonsters that shoot fire arrows. Only\na few potions may not be enough.
To make matters worse, your Wooden\nShield is not well suited to defend you\nfrom fire-based attacks.~~~ I do not\nrecommend that you equip it.
Furthermore, your Iron Shield will not\ndefend you against electrical attacks.~~~\nI do not recommend that you use it.
