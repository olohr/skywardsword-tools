Target lock: <b<Remlit (Day)>><b<\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x259>>
These small creatures inhabit <b<Skyloft>>.\nThey have friendly dispositions during\nthe day, but can become aggressive at\nnight. Approach with caution.
These small animals dwell in <b<Skyloft>>.\nDue to <b<Batreaux>>'s transformation into\na human, they no longer exhibit\naggressive tendencies at night.
Target lock: <b<Remlit (Night) >><b<<b<\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x25A<b<>>
During the day they are quite docile,\nbut after dark their personality turns\naggressive and they will attack. Don't\nbe fooled by their cute appearance.



Target lock: <b<Bilocyte>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x25D
This species of parasite is currently\nattached to <b<Levias>>. It is known for its\nenormous optical structure.\n\nThis horrifying life-form utterly\ncontrols the mind and body of its host.[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
My analysis indicates the projectiles\nspit by the <b<Bilocyte >>can be <r<repelled>>\nby your sword, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nFurthermore, I infer that repelling the\nBilocyte's own projectiles back toward\nit could become a very effective means\nof attack.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
Based on the creature's anatomy,\nit is probable that this monster's\nweakness is its central <r<eye>>.\n\nHowever, I can confirm that while the\n<r<fins>> on the sides of its head are\nextended, any attack on the <r<eye >>will be\nquite ineffective.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Got it.
In order to effectively hit the Bilocyte\nby repelling its projectiles, you must\nconsider the direction in which you are\nswinging your sword.\nBy swinging left and right, you can\ncontrol the direction of the deflection.\n~~~Swinging up or down will deflect\nprojectiles straight back.
This is all the information I have at\nthe present time.\n\n\nWhen I have more information to\nreport, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, your sword will flash.\nYou can always press (v) to call on me.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD\n\nFurthermore, when you require\ninformation about your equipment or\nyour surroundings, please select\n<r<Analysis>>.
Target lock: <b<Walltula>>\n\n\n\nFound mostly in ivy and on walls, you\ncan expect this creature to approach\nwhen it senses your presence.\n\nThe beast lives on other creatures'\nbodily fluids. A fully grown Walltula\nis several orders of magnitude more\ndangerous than a young Walltula.
Target lock: <b<Skulltula>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x2BB
This giant species of spider inhabits the\ndeepest areas of forests. It attacks\nwith highly adhesive webbing in order\nto prevent its prey from escaping.\nIt has a tough outer carapace, but its\nstomach may be vulnerable to attack.\n\n\nI am currently conducting additional\nanalysis into its movement patterns.
This giant species of spider inhabits the\ndeepest areas of forests. It attacks\nwith highly adhesive webbing in order\nto prevent its prey from escaping.\nIt has a tough outer carapace, but its\nstomach may be vulnerable to attack.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
I have observed that it has a tendency\nto move with its back toward its prey\nto prevent its weak point from being\nexposed.\nTherefore, you must find a way to flip\nthe beast over to access its weak point.
I have observed that it has a tendency\nto move with its back toward its prey\nto prevent its weak point from being\nexposed.\nTherefore, you must find a way to flip\nit over to attack its weak point.\n[1]Anything else?[2-]Got it.
Its lone weak point is the center of its\nabdomen, but it is surrounded by tough\nchitin. This leads me to conclude that a\n<g<fatal blow>> will be most effective.
Target lock: <b<Aracha>>\n\n\n\nThis larval monster is said to live for\n1,000 years, during which time it is\ncontinually growing.\n\nThough the larva is small in size, it is\nquite ferocious and is often found in\nswarms beneath the sand.\n\nIt tends to leap toward moving objects\nsuch as yourself.

Target lock: <b<Moldarach>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x262
An <b<Aracha>> that has survived its very\nlengthy larval stage is known as a\n\x201CThousand-Year Arachnid,\" which\nis precisely what you see before you.\nOver 90% of its body is shielded by a\ntough, chitinous armor that can deflect\neven the sharpest blade.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Understood.
The <r<weak points >>are its overdeveloped\npincers, but you must hit each at the\nright angle relative to the pincer's \nposition to be effective.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Got it.
This beast has a tendency to bury itself\nin the sand when it feels its health\nis endangered.\n\nWhen it is burrowed below the sand,\nyou can expect at least an 85% chance\nthat it will attempt to stab you with\nits tail.\nI highly recommend removing the\ncreature's environmental advantage\nby <r<blowing away >>sand, thereby\nrevealing its position.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
Analysis reveals that the creature's\n<r<central eye >>will be vulnerable to\nattack once its pincers have been\nproperly disposed of.\nI calculate a near 100% chance that\nan assault on this weak point will \nultimately prove quite fatal.\n\nHowever, I infer from the armor\nsurrounding the <r<central eye >>that\nhorizontal, vertical, and diagonal\nslashes will be entirely ineffective.
Target lock: <b<Keese>>\n\n\n\nFound in many locations, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves.\n\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
Target lock: <b<Dark Keese>>\n\n\n\nFound in many locations, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves.\n\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
Target lock: <b<Thunder Keese>>\n\n\n\nFound in desert habitats, these winged\nmonsters are attracted to dark places,\nsuch as caves. Their internal organs\ngenerate electricity for attacking prey.\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
Target lock: <b<Fire>><b< Keese>>\n\n\n\nFound near volcanoes, these monsters\nare attracted to dark places, such as\ncaves. Constantly under combustion,\nthey will burn anything on contact.\nThey often gather in colonies, are \nactive at night, and sleep in the day.\nThose who come too close and awaken\nthem often fall victim to attack.
Target lock: <b<Guay>>\n\n\n\nThis bird seemingly jettisons its\ndroppings upon people's heads on\npurpose. It is unclear if this is due to a\ncarefree attitude or pure malice.\nShould its droppings land on you,\nI calculate the probability of your\nintense aggravation at 100%.
Target lock: <b<Furnix>>\n\n\n\nThis spirit bird is said to survive by\neating flames. Due to its cautious\nnature, it can be difficult to approach.\n\nHowever, by catching and holding the\nbird's attention, some are able to\nsuccessfully attack it. I suggest being\nwary of its curled tail.
Target lock: <b<Hrok>>\n\n\n\nThis great bird is remarkable for its\nswollen, red throat. It also ingests\nminerals contained in rocks.\n\nThe small stones it is not able to fully\ndigest are collected in its throat,\nwhich it can then amalgamate and\nregurgitate as fully formed boulders.
Target lock: <b<Red Bokoblin>>\n\n\n\nThese monsters have plagued the land\nsince ancient times. They each play\ndifferent roles, and their weaponry\nvaries. They prefer to act in groups.\nNone of them are intelligent by any\ndefinition of the word. Curiously, they\nseem to have a mysterious obsession\nwith fashionable undergarments.
Target lock: <b<Red Bokoblin (Leader)>>\n\n\n\nAs a symbol of its leadership, this\ncreature wraps a cloth around its head.\nThis visually communicates that it is\nmore dominant than other Bokoblins.\nIt can call its underlings to arms\nusing its horn.
Target lock: <b<Blue Bokoblin>>\n\n\n\nThis is a dangerous form of Bokoblin.\nMy analysis suggests it is many times\nstronger than a Red Bokoblin.\n\nIts skin and clothing differ due to its\nhailing from a different environment,\nbut it still has the same fixation with\nexotic undergarments.







Target lock: <b<Technoblin>>\n\n\n\nThese Bokoblins wield sophisticated\nweaponry created by an ancient\nand highly evolved civilization.\n\nIf you are struck with the discharge\nfrom one of their electrical weapons,\nyou may become paralyzed.\n\nThese creatures also wear the latest in\nBokoblin fashion.
Target lock: <b<Red Bokoblin (Archer)>>\n\n\n\nThese are Red Bokoblins that carry\nbows capable of knocking down distant\ntargets.\n\nThough not obvious from their outward\nappearance, their aim is quite deadly.






Target lock: <b<Wooden Shield Moblin>>\n\n\n\nThis massive monster's wall-sized\nshield gives it a tactical advantage.\nWhen its shield is at the ready, most\nattacks will be quite futile.\nThe destruction of its shield is likely to\ndrive the monster into a rage, instantly\nincreasing its threat.
Target lock: <b<Metal Shield Moblin>>\n\n\n\nThis Moblin has a sturdy iron shield.\nOnly a few Moblins are capable of\ncarrying a large, heavy shield of iron\nlike this one.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02I calculate an 85% chance that you can\n<r<climb over >>that large shield as if it\nwere a wall.
Target lock: <b<Green Bokoblin>>\n\n\n\nThis variety of Bokoblin enjoys dark\nplaces, such as caves. Its sunlight-\ndeficient lifestyle has turned its skin\na stomach-turning shade of green.\nHowever, like its red brethren, it\nexhibits a fascination with festive\nundergarments.
Target lock: <b<Green Bokoblin (Archer)>>\n\n\n\nThis variety of Bokoblin inhabits caves\nor indoor environments. It has archery\nskills roughly equivalent to the\nsurface-dwelling Red Bokoblin.\nAlso similar to the surface-dwelling\nRed Bokoblin, the Green Bokoblin\nobsesses about stylish undergarments.

Target lock: <b<Lizalfos>>\n\n\n\nThis unmistakable monster is equipped\nwith an arm guard made of hard iron.\nGreat physical prowess makes it\ndifficult to predict its movements.\nYou will need to anticipate the\ndirection of its arm guard to\nsuccessfully land an attack on the\nexposed angle.
Target lock: <b<Dark Lizalfos>>\n\n\n\nThis beast has superb fighting skills\nand uses an iron arm guard. Watch for\nquick counterattacks when your\nattacks are repelled\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01, Master.\nThe creature's breath can cause a curse\nthat will prevent you from using your\nsword, so I recommend exercising\nextreme caution.
Target lock: <b<Cursed Bokoblin>>\n\n\n\nThis horrifying Bokoblin reanimates\nafter death. Analysis indicates it fears\npure, shiny items and will <r<startle at\nthe sight of a sacred shield>>.\nIt is able to reanimate purely through\nits hatred of this world...and its\nattachment to outlandish underpants.
Target lock: <b<Staldra>>\n\n\n\nThis is a snake monster from before\nthe dawn of time.~~~ Three bone-plated\nheads and a thirst to cause pain keep\nit writhing even beyond death.\nMy analysis shows that to defeat this\ncursed snake, all three of its heads\nmust be simultaneously destroyed.
Target lock: <b<Stalfos>>\n\n\n\nThis skeleton soldier is born of the\ndead. In its previous life, it was an\nordinary knight, but undeath has\nimproved its combat abilities.\nIt is possible to overpower it with\na well-timed <g<shield bash >>during the\ncreature's attack.
Target lock: <b<Stalmaster>>\n\n\n\nThis is an elite captain of the undead\nsoldiers. When provoked, it has the\nability to strike with all four of its\nsword-wielding arms.\nI recommend inflicting damage\nwhen the slight gap presents itself\nas it readies its swords to attack.
Target lock: <b<LD-002S Scervo>>\n\n\n\nThis mutinous robot stole this ship\nfrom Skipper long ago. He still\ncommands the ship today.\n\nWhen fighting in a narrow space like\nthis, it is more effective to use <r<thrust>>\nattacks with your sword than to try to\nswing your sword widely.
Target lock: <b<Koloktos>>\n\n\n\nThis \x201CAncient Automaton\" defends\nthe <b<Ancient Cistern >>and eliminates\nintruders.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x288
The cursed energy supply Ghirahim\nprovided to this contraption has\ngiven it power far beyond its\nconventional limits.\nThe <r<red, orb-shaped cores >>embedded\nin its torso and arms provide it limited\nstability and prevent it from falling\nto pieces.\n[1]More info![2-]Understood.
It is highly probable that if the <r<red\ncores >>in its arms were to be ejected,\nthe unit would lose integrity and the\nlimbs would sever from the body.\nHowever, during normal operation the\ncores are likely hidden below the\nforearm plating.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
Results from my analysis show that the\n<r<red cores>> in Koloktos's arms will only\nbe revealed when the arms are\nstretched out to full length.\nFast and timely counterattacks after\nKoloktos swings its arms down have\nthe best chance of success.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
I estimate a high probability that the\n<r<red cores >>can be removed using your\n<y<whip>>.\n\nWhen Koloktos's arms lower, there\nwill be a brief moment when you can \nattack the <r<chest core>>. \n\nHowever, when targeting the <r<chest\ncore>>, there is nowhere to hook on to\nwith your <y<whip>>. Therefore, removing\nthe core will not be possible.
Target lock: <b<Ghirahim>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x289
I have no confirmed information about\nthis man, other than he refers to\nhimself as a \x201CDemon Lord.\"\n\nI sense a powerful and evil aura, and I\nestimate his level of ability as highly\nadept. However, according to analysis,\nhe has yet to reveal his true power.\n[1]More info![2-]Understood.
Speech analysis indicates absolute\nconfidence in his own abilities.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, you must watch for Ghirahim's\nability to grasp your sword with his\nbare <r<right hand>>.\n\nIt is highly probable that he observes\nthe <r<angle you hold your sword at>> and\nprepares his defense accordingly.\n\nI recommend attacking from the\ndirection opposite his hand.\n[1]More info![2-]I'm ready.
Should he catch hold of your sword,\nI recommend swinging in the\n<r<direction Ghirahim's hand opens>>.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
My analysis confirms that <r<Ghirahim>>'s \nfingers always point upward when\nhe holds \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01your sword, Master.\n\nThe probability of escaping his grip\n<r<by swinging your sword upward>>\nis approximately 100%.
I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style from the beginning of \nthe battle. \n\nI theorize that this change happened\nbecause of the small amount of damage\nhe sustained.[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
Analysis indicates that the daggers\nGhirahim shoots will align on a single\nplane in one of three orientations:\nhorizontal, vertical, or diagonal.\nWith good timing, you might be able to\nrepel them with a single swing of your\nsword, but my judgment shows that this\nmaneuver will be difficult.[1]Anything else?[2-]Got it.
I can now confirm that Ghirahim has\nthe ability to teleport.\n\n\nFurther study reveals that he may be\nvulnerable immediately after\nteleportation. This is your chance to\nattack.\nHowever, be aware Ghirahim may use\nhis sword to guard against just such\nan attack.\n[1]Anything else?[2-]Got it.
Ghirahim will repeatedly move around\nyou, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master. I recommend <r<engaging>> \nhim with your sword as he makes his\nattack.\nIt is probable that the moment before\nGhirahim readies his attack, he will\nreveal the direction he will move\nas he attempts to flank you.\nIf you are unable to establish the\ncorrect timing to attack, I suggest\nusing your <g<spin attack>>.
Target lock: <b<Ghirahim>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28A
Ghirahim is the <b<Demon Lord >>leading\nthe monsters. He displays superior\nmental and physical prowess, as well\nas expert command of magic.\nThough possessing some gentleman-\nlike qualities, he will devolve to his\ntrue nature when enraged.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
Analysis indicates that the daggers that\nappear around Ghirahim also act as a\ndefensive barrier.\n\nRemoving these daggers before\nattacking should be an effective means\nof breaking down his defenses.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
It appears that Ghirahim prefers to\nuse his right hand to attempt to grab\nyour sword, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nShould he succeed, I recommend\n<r<swinging your sword up and down\n>>to force him to release it.\n\nHowever, Ghirahim continues to utilize\nmore of his true power, and the\nprobability of it taking more than one\nswing to release your sword is 100%.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
To land an attack on Ghirahim, I\nadvise you to swing your sword from a\ndirection that cannot be blocked by\ndaggers or Ghirahim's right hand.\nGhirahim will move his right hand\nin time with your attacks. However,\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, there will be times when <r<he is\ntoo slow to meet your attack>>.
I have detected a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style since the beginning of\nthe battle.\n\nI have concluded that this change\nhappened because of the small amount\nof damage he sustained.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
When Ghirahim shoots his daggers,\nI recommend repelling them by\nswinging your sword along the line\nthe knives are positioned in.\nLogically, if surrounded by daggers,\nusing <r<a sword technique that attacks in \nall directions >>would be effective.\n[1]Anything else?[2-]I'm ready.
There will be a significant opening for\ncounterattacks if you are able to avoid\nGhirahim's overhead attack when he\nteleports above your head.\nHe will teleport to places other than\nabove you, of course, but my analysis\nconfirms an interesting behavior\npattern.\nHe assumes different stances when he\nplans to teleport above you and when\nhe plans to go somewhere else.\n[1]Anything else?[2-]Got it.
I am confident Ghirahim will use his\nsword to defend against your attacks,\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master.\n\nGhirahim wields two swords, so the\nprobability that he will block two of\nyour sequential attacks is 100%.
Target lock: <b<Ghirahim>>\n\n\n\nThis <b<Demon Lord >>leads the monster\nforces.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28B
There is a 90% change in outward\nappearance compared to previous\nencounters with him. I detect a dark\naura emanating from his entire body.\nBe cautious, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master. This opponent is \nextremely dangerous and likely to\nfell you with a single blow.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Understood.
He is now revealing his true power.\nI am detecting a significant increase\nin muscular strength.\n\nUnfortunately, I must also conclude\nthat none of your weapons will be\neffective against him.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
Analysis indicates that attacks from\nyour sword <r<may drive Ghirahim back>>,\nif ever so slightly, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
I have noted that Ghirahim has a\ntendency to stand near the center of\nthe platform, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nThere is an 85% probability he does\nthis to avoid falling off.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, there is a 95% chance that\nGhirahim will attempt <r<to intercept\nyour sword >>in order to defend against\nyour attacks, just like last time.\nIf you notice a large change in his\nstance, take care to note the <r<position\nof his hand>>.
Target lock: <b<The Imprisoned>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28C
I have insufficient data on this\nmonster.\n\n\nIts enormous size and ominous aura\ncannot be compared with previously\nencountered monsters.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
I can confirm that the <r<sealing spike\n>>observed at the top of its head is the\nsame object originally found in the\n<b<Sealed Grounds>>.\nI hypothesize that damage can be\ninflicted by driving the stone pillar\ninto the monster's head.\n\nBut first, I recommend attacking the\nbeast's feet--where your sword can\nreach--to stop it from moving.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
It is probable that the monster will be\nunable to move if you destroy all of\nits toes.\n\nI recommend using the air vents to\nmove ahead of the monster instead\nof chasing it from behind.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
If you are able to get between the\nmonster's toes, my analysis indicates\nyou can effectively inflict great\ndamage with a <g<spin attack>>.\nYou can also choose to decrease your\nrisk of physical harm by using <y<bombs>> to\nattack from a distance.
Target lock: <b<The Imprisoned>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28D
There is insufficient data on this target\nto make a full report at this time.\n\n\nBut I can confirm the appearance of\nlimb-like appendages that were not\npreviously present. The evil power of\nthis creature has also increased.[1]More info![2-]Understood.
Analysis indicates that you should be\nable to use the same basic strategy as in\nthe previous encounter to seal the\nmonster in its prison once more.\nThe fingers and toes on its limbs can be\ndestroyed with a physical attack, but\nyou should wait to do so until these\ntargets become a very high priority.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
I calculate a 100% probability that the\nlarge apparatus Groose constructed\nwill be effective against this\nmonster.\nIt is likely that a direct hit from this\napparatus will stop the monster's\nmovement, creating a window of\nopportunity for you to attack.[1]More info![2-]Got it.
<b<Groose>>'s defense apparatus can be\nrepositioned by pushing \x0E\x02\x04\x02\xECD.\n\n\nWhen the monster is in your blind spot,\nI recommend you reposition the\napparatus and target the monster.
Target lock: <b<The Imprisoned>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28E
Though the details are still unclear,\nthis monstrosity is the demonic vessel\nof <b<Demise>>.\n\nI can confirm a previously unseen\ntaillike appendage.\n\n\nI recommend generous use of <b<Groose>>'s \ncatapult.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
You must attempt to seal this beast\naway again. I suggest a plan of attack\nsimilar to what you used in previous\nencounters.\nThe monster's fingers, like its toes, are\ncomparatively soft targets and can be\ndestroyed by physical attack.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
After toppling the monster, it is\npossible that the beast's enormous bulk\nmay prevent you from approaching\nthe <r<sealing spike>>.\nIn this scenario, I recommend that you\ndescend a level and use an air vent to\ntravel to the head of the monster.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
The monster has evolved to an\nimmensely powerful state. I calculate\nthe odds you will defeat it by sword\nalone at approximately 0%.\nI recommend you utilize Groose's\ndefense apparatus. As a last-ditch\nmeasure, you can launch <r<yourself>>,\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, as a projectile.
Target lock: <b<Demise>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x28F
This eternal being has conquered time\nitself. It is the source of all monsters.\n\n\nAccording to tales passed down through\ngenerations, it appears differently in\neach epoch and to each person who\nlays eyes on it.[1]Tell me more![2-]Understood.
It is highly probable that the only\nweapon capable of wounding Demise\nis the <y<Master Sword >>itself. No other\nweapon can affect it.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
The probability that a single, standard\nattack of yours will injure Demise,\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, is exactly 0%.\n\nA series of attacks that can overwhelm\nDemise's guard is required, such as\n<r<repeated slashing from various angles>>.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
Results from my analysis confirm that\nthe time to strike Demise is when he\nholds his sword aloft.\n\nHowever, vigilance is required.~~~\nAny attack falling near Demise's sword\nhas a 100% chance of being blocked.




Target lock: <b<Demise>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x290
I can confirm it is possible for Demise\nto store the electrical energy of a\nlightning strike in his sword and use it\nto his advantage.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, should your sword come into\ncontact with Demise's sword once it\nhas electrified, you will receive a\npainful shock.\nIt is essential that you time your\nattacks carefully. Very carefully.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Understood.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, I see no reason why you cannot\nmake use of the lightning strikes the\nsame way Demise does.\n[1]Tell me more![2-]Got it.
It is possible to store lightning in the\n<r<Master Sword >>by raising your sword\nin the air as if you were readying a\n<r<Skyward Strike>>.\nWhen lightning strikes in the distance\nand the sky lights up, quickly raise\nyour sword skyward to call down the\nlightning.\nHowever, be aware that while you are\nattempting to be struck by lightning,\nyou will be leaving yourself open to\nDemise's attacks.
I can confirm it is possible for Demise\nto store the electrical energy of a\nlightning strike in his sword and use it\nto his advantage.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, should your sword come into\ncontact with Demise's sword once it\nhas electrified, you will receive a\npainful shock.[1]Tell me more.[2-]Understood.
I need more time to complete my\nanalysis of Demise.\n\n\nIn a few moments, use (Z) to lock on to\nDemise, and then call me with (v).\nI will report my findings then.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x7CD\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD
It is clear that <r<Skyward Strikes >>cannot\nbe called down to your sword because\nthis place is under the magical\ninfluence of Demise.\nAttacks using <r<Skyward Strike energy\n>>will not be possible here.\n[1]Tell me more.[2-]Got it.
Target lock: <b<Octorok (Grass)>>\n\n\n\nThis monster descended from oceanic\nmollusks. It has developed the\nunsightly ability to spit rocks.\n\nThe creature prefers to sleep with tufts\nof grass on its head, so it has learned to\ntake on the appearance of grass in\norder to fool and defeat its prey.\nYou can use a shield to bounce the\nrocks this monster spits back at it.
Target lock: <b<Octorok (Rock)>>\n\n\n\nThis monster descended from oceanic\nmollusks. It has developed the\nunsightly ability to spit rocks.\n\nInexplicably, this beast prefers to sleep\nwith rocks on its head. It camouflages\nitself to surprise and defeat its prey.\n\nYou can use a shield to bounce the\nrocks this monster spits back at it.
Target lock: <b<Red Chuchu>>\n\n\n\nThe red Chuchu has an exceedingly\nhigh body temperature. Avoid all\nphysical contact, or your clothing\nand shield may burst into flames.\nIn the event you are set on fire,\nI recommend you quickly extinguish\nthe flames by performing a <g<roll>>.
Target lock: <b<Blue Chuchu>>\n\n\n\nThis is a rare, aquatic Chuchu. Known\nfor attaching itself to unaware victims,\nits gelatinous body will clog your air\npipe, literally taking your breath away.\nIt is exceedingly dangerous to allow\none of the larger specimens to stick\nto you for any length of time.
Target lock: <b<Yellow Chuchu>>\n\n\n\nYellow Chuchus are capable of\ngenerating electricity for short bursts\nof time. As with other Chuchus,\nI suggest you remain on guard.\nIf you make contact with this type of\nChuchu when it is charged, it will give\nyou a shock. Then it will attempt to\nfeed on you. This is not pleasant.
Target lock: <b<Green Chuchu>>\n\n\n\nThese creatures prefer exceptionally\ndamp environments. They will\nencompass and digest anything they\ncan absorb into their gelatinous bodies.\nAs they have no genders,\nthey are believed to increase their\npopulation by dividing themselves\ninto several smaller-sized Chuchus.
Target lock: <b<Pyrup>>\n\n\n\nThis skittish monster prefers to hide\nin small holes or inside the skeletal\nremains of deceased creatures.\n\nOnce the cowardly Pyrup finds a small\nspace from which to spit flames, it\nbecomes unapproachable.\n\nYou will need to employ a clever\nstrategy to defeat it. <r<Inflicting damage\nfrom a distance may be the only way>>.

Target lock: <b<Scaldera>>\n\n\n\nThis fearsome monster inhabits the\ndeepest recesses of the <b<Earth Temple>>.\nIt can be categorized as a Pyroclastic\nFiend.\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x299
Its body is completely covered in rock,\nbut you can see its weak point, the <r<eye>>,\nthrough the cracks in this outer shell.\n\nIf you are able to remove parts of this\ncreature's rocky shell, you will vastly\nincrease your probability of success.[1]More info![2-]Understood.
There is a 0% probability that your\nsword will be effective against the\nrock that covers this target's body.\n\nI strongly recommend using items with\npowerful destructive properties.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
There is a 100% probability that <y<bombs>>\nthat come into contact with Scaldera's\nbody will immediately explode, due to\nthe creature's high body temperature.\nAnalysis indicates that explosions on\nScaldera's outer surface will not yield\ndesired results, however. You must\nlook for a more effective target site.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
Results from my analysis confirm that\nin order to remove the rocks covering\nScaldera, you will need to inflict\npowerful internal damage.\nWhen Scaldera is inhaling a large\namount of air, I suggest<r< throwing a\nbomb >><r<into its mouth>>.
Target lock: <b<Magmanos>>\n\n\n\nThis hand-shaped monster dwells\nin fiery lava. Its body is made up\nentirely of flowing magma. As such, it\nis invulnerable to most attacks.\nTheoretically, it would be possible to\ninflict damage on the monster if you\nwere able to <r<solidify its body>>.

Target lock: <b<Ampilus\n>>\n\n\nThese monsters have inhabited the\ndesert for eons. Their defining\ncharacteristic is an ability to internally\ngenerate electrical energy.\nIt is also said they live to a very old\nage. Their shells are able to disperse\nweight surprisingly well, allowing them\nto safely traverse desert sinksand.
Target lock: <b<Armos>>\n\n\n\nThis security and defense mechanism\nwas developed long ago. It will attack\nanything that enters its security\nperimeter.\nAccording to my records, its weak\npoint is its mouth, but it requires some\nspecific measure to make it open\nits mouth.
Target lock: <b<Beamos>>\n\n\n\nThis is an ancient security mechanism.\nIts weak point is its eye. The eye is also\na weapon that fires a focused energy\nbeam.\nI calculate a 100% failure rate at any\nattempt to strike the eye with your \nsword while it is still on top of the\npedestal.\nI recommend using a weapon that\ncan strike at high targets. Conversely,\nyou could lower its head to a height\nyour sword can reach.
Target lock: <b<Sentrobe>>\n\n\n\nThis security drone was built in\nancient times. It is armed with missiles\nfired from a central turret and flying\nbombs fired from both of its sides.\nAnalysis suggests you can repel the\nmissiles fired from the central turret\nwith certain items at your disposal,\nsuch as your shield.
Target lock: <b<Froak>>\n\n\n\nThough this odd creature is cowardly\nby nature, it will expose an array of\ndensely packed defensive spines\nwhen approached or provoked.
Target lock: <b<Cranioc>>\n\n\n\nThis fishlike monster is said to settle\ndisputes with another of its species\npurely by the magnificence of its\nbulbous crowns.\nWhen this creature chooses its prey,\nit will turn red with excitement and\ncharge head-on. Stopping such an\nassault could prove difficult.
Target lock: <b<Magma Spume>>\n\n\n\nThis odd creature is quite at home in\nmagma. It stores and processes gas\nproduced by the magma into a flaming\nprojectile that it then spits out.\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust out of the lava in order to detect\nany danger and flee if necessary.
Target lock: <b<Cursed Spume>>\n\n\n\nThis mysterious monster's natural\nhabitat includes poisonous swamps and\nother dangerous environments. It spits\nevil curses that it stores up in its body.\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust above the surface in order to\ndetect any danger and flee if\nnecessary.
Target lock: <b<Electro Spume\n>>\n\n\nAt home in the desert, this monster\nspits a wad-like, electrified projectile\nthat it produces internally.\n\nCowardly by nature, it sits with its eyes\njust above the surface in order to\ndetect any danger and flee if\nnecessary.
Target lock: <b<Tentalus>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x2A5
As you can likely gather from its other\ntitle, this \x201CAbyssal Leviathan\" is said to\nhave been a tyrant of the ancient seas.\n\nIts <y<<r<enormous tentacles<y< >>can be repelled,\nbut they will regenerate after a\nshort time.\n[1]More info![2-]Understood.
My analysis shows that by repelling\na number of its aggressive tentacles,\nthe beast will reveal itself.\n\nThere is a 99% probability that the\ntentacles that attacked you on the ship,\nMaster, can be attributed to Tentalus.\n\nI theorize that using a <r<sacred power>> \nwill be the most effective means\nof repelling the tentacles.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
Results from my analysis confirm that\nits tentacles can be severed with a\nwell-aimed <r<Skyward Strike>>.\n\nI theorize that the creature's <r<eye>> is its \nweak point, but the probability that you\ncan actually hit the eye with a Skyward\nStrike is approximately 0%.\nInstead, I recommend utilizing\nlong-range weapons.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
To accurately strike at the creature's\n<y<eye>>--its weak spot--a <y<bow>> will be most\neffective.\n\nYou can press \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x8CD to move with your\n<r<<y<bow<r< >>drawn. I recommend shooting\n<r<arrows >>immediately after dodging\nattacks launched by Tentalus.
In order to attack Tentalus's weak\nspot, its <r<eye>>, you must first deal with\nthe tentacles attempting to latch on\nto you.\nMy analysis shows you can easily\nslice the tip of the tentacles with\nyour sword.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
Because this monster's tentacles attack\nincessantly and in large number, it is\ntoo dangerous to respond to them one\nat a time.\nMy analysis indicates it is possible to\nrepel the tentacles more efficiently by\nconcentrating an all-out assault on\nthem with your sword.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
When the tentacles are repelled,\nthey may drop <r<hearts>> and <r<arrows>>.\n\n\nShould you find yourself in danger\nbecause of low hearts or arrows,\nconcentrate on attacking the tentacles\nrather than fleeing from battle.
Target lock: <b<Deku Baba>>\n\n\n\nThis violent plant is widespread in\nwooded areas. It will attempt to bite\nanything that approaches it.\n\nThough it is covered in a tough outer\nhusk, the inside of its mouth is soft.\n\n\nI have confirmed the existence of\ntwo varieties: those that open their\nmouths <r<vertically >>and those that\nopen them <r<horizontally>>.
Target lock: <b<Quadro Baba>>\n\n\n\nThis violent plant is widespread in\nwooded areas. It will attempt to bite\nanything that approaches it.\n\nMore rare than <b<Deku Baba>>, Quadro\nBaba has greater stamina. A golden\nhusk and dynamic mouth are this\nplant's distinguishing features.

Target lock: <b<Peahat>>\n\n\n\nAt first glance, this looks like any other\nplant species, but the Peahat has a\nunique ability to fly when the flower on\nits top is pulled off with a <y<whip>>.





Target lock: <b<Sentrobe Bomb>>\n\n\n\nThis is a bomb projectile fired from a\n<b<Sentrobe>>. It will follow its target\nanywhere, although a timed fuse\nensures it will explode after a set time.
Target lock: <b<LD-003D Dreadfuse>>\n\n\n\nThis menacing robot guards Sky Keep.\nIt is thought to be of a similar model\nto the robot that stole Skipper's ship\nin <b<Lanayru Sand Sea>>.\nAs before, when fighting in a narrow\nspace like this, it is more effective to\nuse <r<thrust >>attacks with your sword than\nto try to swing your sword widely.
Target lock: <b<Ghirahim>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x2B1
There is a 90% change in outward\nappearance compared to previous\nencounters with him. I detect a dark\naura emanating from his entire body.\nI can confirm a change in Ghirahim's\nfighting style, likely as a result of the\nminor damage he has suffered.[1]More info![2-]Understood.
I project that the <r<weak spot revealed\non his chest >>from the previous attack\nwill continue to be an effective target.\n\nHowever, there is a 100% probability\nthat Ghirahim will block all attacks\ntargeting this area while he is in his\nstandard state.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
I suggest you attempt to parry\nGhirahim's sword away, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\nThis should leave the <r<weak spot on\nhis chest>> open to attack.\nTaking advantage of opportunities to\nattack the villain's weak spot should\nbe your top priority.[1]More info![2-]Got it.
My analysis shows that it is impossible\nto parry away Ghirahim's sword\nin one attack.\n\nI theorize that it will become possible\nby <r<attacking in the same direction>>\na number of times.
Target lock: <b<Ghirahim>>\x0E\x01\x0C\x04\x06\x2B2
There has been a 90% change in his\noutward appearance since our last\nmeeting. I detect a black aura\nemanating from his entire body.\nI have also confirmed that he is\nusing a new weapon.\n[1]More info![2-]Understood.

Results from my analysis confirm that\nthe sword Ghirahim wields <r<can be\nbroken >>by your sword, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nI theorize that Ghirahim used magic\nto call this weapon into existence.\n\n\nNow that he is deeply wounded,\nthe sword he wields appears to\nhave become brittle.\n[1]More info![2-]Got it.
I have detected identical responses\nfrom <r<the center of Ghirahim's sword\nand Ghirahim's chest>>.\n\nBy destroying the <r<sword's core>>, there is\na 100% probability that the sword itself\nwill be destroyed.\n\nI recommend carefully watching the\nsword's movement and repeatedly\nattacking the <r<same spot>>.
