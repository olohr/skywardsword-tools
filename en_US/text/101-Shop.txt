It pains me to tell you, friend, but...\n\n\n\nIt appears your pouch is full. May I\nsuggest you stow some of your\nbelongings at the Item Check?

Ahhhh, it pains me to say this, but...\n\n\n\nI believe you are already carrying\nyour limit for this item. Perhaps you\ncould turn your attention to any of\nmy other magnificent wares...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x08Oh my!\x0E\x01\x05\x04\n\x00\n

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02You've got quite an eye, friend. Those\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02\x08>> do make a\nstrong point!\n\nDo be careful not to accidentally shoot\npeople! That would be quite rude.\nThey cost a mere <r<20 Rupees>>.\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
I do apologize, but I can't sell you\nthis unless you have a bow. It's\nstore policy, you see.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Ahaa! I see you eyeing those\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02)>>. So loud. So\nsatisfyingly smoky. And, oh yes,\nso very destructive!\nOne good blast, and even a sturdy\nwall can't hope to remain standing.\n\n\nKA-BOOM! All yours for <r<20 Rupees>>.\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.
Ahaa! Very sorry, but I can't sell you\nthose unless you have a Bomb Bag.\nAgain, my apologies.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Ahaa! That's a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02t>>.\nYou can use it to block and repel\nattacks!\n\nYou must be careful, though, as it will\n<r<break >>if it takes too much abuse.\n\n\nOh, and don't forget about fire. It will\nburn quite easily... It's an unfortunate\nproperty of wood. It could be yours for\n<r<50 Rupees>>.\nCare to buy it, friend?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Ahaa! That there is a very sturdy\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02w>>.\n\n\nIt's much more durable than a\nwooden shield, and I'm happy to\nreport that it won't burst into flames!\n\nI suppose I should warn you that it\nwon't protect you from electricity,\nwhich could come as a nasty...shock.\n\nIt's yours for just <r<100 Rupees>>.\nCare to buy it, friend?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Ahaa! That's a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02z>>!\nAs you might surmise from its name, it\ncan handle all variety of attacks!\n\nFire? Not a sweat! Electricity? No\npainful zaps! Plus, it will automatically\nrepair itself when it sustains damage!\n\nIt's a little fragile, but that shouldn't\nbe a problem for one as talented and\nagile as yourself! \n\nAt a cost of <r<500 Rupees>>, it's an\ninvestment...but an excellent one!\nCare to buy it?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02I see you have an interest in \n<y<10 >><y<\x0E\x02\x01\x029>>! They\nare truly the perfectly matched\nprojectile for a slingshot.\nThey could be yours for <r<20 Rupees>>.\nCare to buy them today?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
My friend...you don't appear to have\na slingshot.\n\n\nI simply couldn't sell you these in good\nconscience if you do not have a\nslingshot. Perhaps I can interest you\nin some of my other wares...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02That's a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02>>.\nWith this in your pouch, you can\ncarry 10 additional seeds.\n\nRecommended for slingshot\nenthusiasts! It costs <r<100 Rupees>>.\nDo we have a deal, friend?\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02That's a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02>>. Just \nslip this into your pouch, and you can\ncarry five additional bombs.\n\nIf you relish a good explosion, this is\nthe item for you! It costs a mere\n<r<150 Rupees>>. Care to buy it, friend?\n[1]OK! [2-]No, thanks.
