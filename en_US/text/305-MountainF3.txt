I'm afraid that eruption was caused by\nan explosion of my power. It looks like\nyou were caught up in it. My apologies.\n\nThe skies above this land should clear\nsoon...\n\n\nYou should go.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x701Yes... You appear as if summoned!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700Young hero, do you wish to ask a\nquestion of me?\n[1]<b<Water Dragon>>?[2]<b<Thunder Dragon>>?[3]Volcano?[4-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x702Yes... The <b<Water Dragon>>. You see,\nthe goddess gave the Water Dragon\nthe power to protect the woods.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700That power is strong, but the will of the\ndragon is even stronger. ...You may\nwant to be careful with that one, lest\nyou be eaten like an appetizer.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x703Ha ha ha ha!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x702Yes, yes... The <b<Thunder Dragon>>.\nThe goddess gave the Thunder Dragon\nthe power to protect the desert.\n\nThis dragon possesses a <r<legendary\nshield>>. It is truly one of its most prized\ntreasures.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700It is said that the Thunder Dragon\ndelights in testing those with promise\nin the hopes of someday finding a\nworthy recipient for the shield.\nBut the dragon is a wily one. And his\ntest is not as simple as it may appear!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03Ha ha ha ha!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x702Yes... This mountain was not always\nsuch a dangerous and unforgiving\nplace.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700There was a time when those above-\nground and those below lived together\nin harmony by the blessing of the\ngreat mountain.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700The desolation that you see now is all\nthat remains to remind us of those\nglorious days...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x702Yes... You see the path before you,\nthen. Go. Follow it.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700What is this? You have another\nquestion for me?\n[1]<b<Water Dragon>>?[2]<b<Thunder Dragon>>?[3]Volcano?[4-]Not really.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nAnd I probably don't even need to say\nthis again... But seriously, pal, don't\nlet them bad guys see ya, y'hear?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xE00They ain't gonna do nothin' nice if they\ncatch you!
