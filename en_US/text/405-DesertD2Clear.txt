This is <r<Nayru's Flame>>, vrrm! Just\nlooking at it makes my circuits hum,\nvweeeeep.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900In fact, the protection of the flame\nis what allowed us to fix the ship so\nquickly, brrzrrt!
Once we're all ready, our ship will set\nsail on this glorious sea once again,\nphoo-weep!
Thanks for getting my ship back, vrrm!
And these guys will get what's coming\nto them later, don't you worry, vweep!
What a view, vrrm.~~.~~.
Timeshift Stones propel our ship,\nvweep! That's why we have to make\nsure nothing hits them, brrzrrt...
There's nothing finer than seeing the\nwhole crew standing at attention with\nthe wind in their servos, phoo-weep!
Our precious treasure is gone, brrzrrt!\nWho stole it, vrrm?!
That's our precious treasure, zrrt!\nDon't touch it, vrrm!
We're getting ready for our next\nvoyage, vweep! But the captain is\nworking us so hard I think my\ngears are grinding, vrrm...
This control room transmits the power\nof the Timeshift Stones to the engine\nroom, zrrrt. No unauthorized entry!
This is the engine room, brrzrrt.\nWe're getting ready for a long\njourney, vweep. Try not to get\ncrushed in here, vrrm!
There were more crew members\noriginally, but after our ship was\ntaken, many of them decided to\npursue other functions, vrrm.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900This next journey across the seas is\na mission to reunite with our\nmissing crew members, phoo-weep!
Nothing is finer than sailing the high\nseas, phoo-weep! Are you coming with\nus, vrrm?
We're so proud of our captain, vweep!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x03\x900There's nothing we wouldn't do for\nhim, vrrm!
Standing here on the bow brings back\nso many memory functions, vweep.~~.~~.\nSome good, some bad, but such is the\nlife of a sailor, zrrt!
