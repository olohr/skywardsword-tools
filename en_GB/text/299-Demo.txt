Look who it is...
I thought that tornado I stirred up\nwould have tossed and torn you apart,\nyet here you are. Not in pieces.
Not that your life or death has any\nconsequence.
It's just the girl that matters now, \nand I can sense her here...just beyond\nthis door.\n\nYes, we plucked Her Majesty from her\nperch in the clouds, and now she's ours.
Oh, but listen to me. I'm being\npositively uncivil. Allow me to\nintroduce myself.\n\nI am the Demon Lord who presides\nover this land you look down upon, this\nworld you call the surface. You may\ncall me <b<\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDGhirahim>>.\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02Í\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDIn truth, \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍI very much prefer to be \nindulged with my full title:\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDLord Ghirahim.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\x0E\x01\x08\x02Í But I'm not fussy.
Did you really just draw your sword?\nFoolish boy.
By all rights the girl should have fallen\ninto our hands already.
She was nearly ours when that\nloathsome servant of the goddess\nsnatched her away.\n\nDo you have any idea how that made\nme feel inside?
~~~Furious!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E Outraged!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x19\nSick with anger!\x0E\x01\x04\x02- 


This turn of events has left me with a\nstrong appetite for bloodshed.
Still...it hardly seems fair, being of my\nposition, to take all of my anger out\non you.\n\nWhich is why I promise up front not to\nmurder you...
No, I'll just beat you within an inch of\nyour life!

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I have a message written in the\nlanguage of the gods of old. Allow me\nto translate for you.
<y+<From the edge of time I guide you,\nthe one chosen to carry out the\ngoddess's mission.>>
<y+<The spirit maiden who descended\nfrom the clouds must travel to two\nsacred places to purify her body.\n>>\n<y+<You stand in one of these places:\n<r<Skyview Spring<y+<. The other is known\nas the <r<Earth Spring<y+<.<r<<y+<>>
<y+<This second spring is hidden away deep\nwithin the scorched earth of <r<Eldin<y+<.>><y+<\n\n\n<y+<The spirit maiden, ever mindful of the\nheavy task entrusted to her, has set out\nfor this second sacred place.<y+<>>
You got the <y<Ruby Tablet>>! \nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Raise your sword, Master.
The flames of Farore have improved your\nsword, making it longer and sharp enough\nto do twice as much damage!
The sacred flame has purified your\nblade, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02enhancing and evolving it.
With your sword now enhanced\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02,\nyou are ready to learn a new melody.\nWe should return to the <b<Isle of Songs>>.

Who dares to dip even a toe in my\nwaters without my leave?
Oh, I remember you. You're the\nyoung human who helped me recover\nfrom my injuries.\nAh...Link, was it?
Let's have a look at you... Yes, you\nseem a good deal stronger than the\nlast time we met.\n\nAnd look at that sword... You're the\nreal thing, boy. It's clear you have\nthe spirit of a hero of the goddess.
Let me guess... You swam all the way\nhere to try to get me to teach you the \npart of the <b<Song of the Hero >>the \ngoddess entrusted to me.
That's all well and good, but I can't go\naround giving away something that \nprecious to every hero who flounders\ninto my waters.\nNo, I think a final test is in order to \nensure you are in fact the one meant to\nhear this melody of mine.\n\nThis may be news to you, but some very\nirksome monsters have been \noverrunning my woods of late.\n\nWell, I decided that I'd had enough!\nThe easiest way to deal with the awful\nthings was to flood the whole woods.
As it happens, almost every inch of\ngreenery in the area is submerged.\nSo it's here, in this flooded land, that I\nwill test you.\nIf you're up to completing the task I\nask of you, I see no reason why I\nshouldn't reward you with the melody\nyou seek.

As you just saw, I have split the melody\nyou seek among my many Tadtones and \nI have hidden them around the forest.
If you haven't already guessed,\nLink, here's your task:\nTake this score and <g<collect>> all my little\nmusical friends out there.
You can use that score to figure out\nhow many Tadtones are in each group.\nFind them, collect them, and bring\nthem back to me.
If you can do that, well, then I'll just\nhave to see you as someone worthy of\nlearning the <b<Song of the Hero>>.

You learned part of the <y<Song of the Hero>>!
Ah, you've brought back all my colorful\nlittle Tadtones. \n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700You are indeed worthy of being called\na hero. This much is clear. I'm good for\nmy word, so I will teach you my part\nof the song you seek.
Originally, I had planned to keep these\nwoods underwater so that those awful\nmonsters could never return.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700But your task is far from over, and\nyou're not exactly at home in the water.\nI suppose I'll return the woods to their\nnatural state.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700All this excitement has been rather\ndraining. I believe I'll retire to my hall.\nYou'd best be on your way as well.
