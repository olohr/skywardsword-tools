Ancient Cistern
Strike the <r<gemstones pointing in\nfour directions >>wisely. The way\nwill only open for one who knows\nthe temple's <r<secret order>>.
Carved into the <r<great statue\n>>are inscriptions of gratitude.\nThey reveal the <r<secret order >>of\nthis temple.\nFirst the <r<back>>, then the <r<rear>>,\nthen the <r<back of the right hand>>,\nand finally the <r<back of the left\nhand>>.
Return the stone giant to its\noriginal form, and descend\nbelow the earth again along\nthe thread.\nThere you will find the <r<key >>to\nthe path ahead.
Look for the <r<key >>that lies\nbeneath the earth.
A gemstone shines deep within\nthe eye. Strike it to shut the\nmouth and dam the flow.



Based on the patterns we have seen\nso far, I believe the <r<key >>mentioned on\nthe stone marker is the <r<key >>required\nto unlock the device ahead of us.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I have some important\ninformation that I am certain\nyou will want to hear. There is a\nlarge treasure chest in the area.\nThere is an 85% probability it\ncontains the <r<key >>that will open the \ndoor we observed at the top of the\nstone statue.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I have taken the liberty to\nconfirm that a door is located at\nthe uppermost section of this statue.\nThe lock is unfamiliar to me.




You certainly are persistent.~~.~~.
I'm terribly busy trying to find the\nclues that will help me revive the\ndemon king.
Your incessant buzzing around my\nhead like some irksome gadfly\nwhen I'm THIS busy is... Well, it's\nmaking me very disagreeable.
