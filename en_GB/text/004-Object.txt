Do you want to leave this\nSilent Realm?\n[1]Leave.[2-]Stay.
Hey! \x0E\x03\x01\x00Link! You're not\nthinking of running away, are you?\n\n\nHah! Surely you jest! A real man\nalways finishes what he starts!
\x0E\x01\x0F\x00Your shield broke!\x0F\x01\x0F
\x0E\x01\x0F\x00Your \x0E\x02\x01\x02~ has\nrefilled your shield gauge!\x0F\x01\x0F
Your pouch is full, so the item was sent to\nthe <r<Item Check>>!
Your pouch is full, but so is your space at\nthe <r<Item Check>>. The item has been put\nback in a treasure chest.
Boing-oing!
You can get a valuable treasure if\nyou succeed in cutting the bamboo\nstalk <r<over 28 times >>at <b<Clean Cut>>.\n\nPeater, who was formerly the teen\nheartthrob of Skyloft, claims to hold\nthe record with 43 slices. Or so\nhe says...
You may get rare and difficult-to-\ncatch bugs if you finish the Bug\nWrangler challenge in <b<Bug Heaven>>\n<r<within two minutes>>.
Butterflies tend to gather around \nGossip Stones like myself.\n\n\nIf you find a spot swarming with\nbutterflies, play a<r< tune of great beauty>>\nand a Gossip Stone might just pop\nout of the ground with a boing-oing!
I've heard some of the <b<Goddess Cubes\n>>unlock all sorts of treasure when they\nfly up into the sky. Some even hold\na <r<Piece of Heart>>.
<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02$ >>cause something to\nhappen when they are thrown on bugs\nor monsters. They can be collected\nfrom sparkly mushrooms.
If you can dig up all the Rupees in\nMr. Tubert's <b<Thrill Digger>>, you'll\nreceive a rare treasure.
Deep underground, below this volcano,\nyou'll find treasure-loving <b<Mogmas>>.\n\n\nThese days, most of them are content\nwith staying down in their lair, where\nthey do nothing but relax all day.
Do you want to hear that again?\n[1]Yes.[2-]No.
A <r<dragon>> is said to live at the <r<peak >>of\nthis volcano. You're nowhere near the\npeak, though!
Rumor has it you're some kind of\ngenius that remembers things perfectly\nthe first time you hear them...
I hear the <r<dragon>> that lives at the\ntop of the volcano is awfully chatty.\n\n\nSo chatty, they say, that he's even\nwilling to talk about matters outside\nhis own realm!
The word going around is that a <r<dragon>>\nwrapped in flames lives atop this\nvolcano.\n\nThe thing is, it isn't so easy to visit.\nHe's made his lair <r<somewhere so hot\n>>that normal folks can't bother him.
Word is you can earn a <r<Piece of Heart>>\nif you set a great time on the <b<Rickety\nCoaster>>.
They say somewhere in this vast desert,\nthere's a <r<dragon>> who loves putting the\nabilities of those who visit him to some\nkind of test.\nIf you can master the challenges he\nthrows at you, you'll be rewarded with\na <r<shield stronger than any other>>.
It's been said that the best way to snag\na rare insect is to approach it slowly\nand use a <y<Big Bug Net>>.
Rumor has it that drawing an arrow\nshape on certain walls will cause an\nobject of similar shape to appear.
Apparently, if you draw a symbol of\nmoney on certain walls, you can make\nan easy fortune.
They say drawing a symbol of love upon\ncertain walls will heal your wounds.
Oddly enough, it seems that drawing\na circle on certain strange walls will\nproduce something round.
They say it's possible to summon\n<y<Fairies>> by drawing three triangles\nupon certain walls.
Rumor has it there's a <y<Piece of Heart\n>>hidden somewhere nearby.
The thing is, to get to it you need to be\nable to burrow like a <b<Mogma>>.
Oh, but since you've already picked it\nup, this obviously doesn't come as a\nbig surprise to you. Hmph.
\x0E\x01\x0F\x00How long do you want to sleep?\x0F\x01\x0F\n[1]Until morning.[2]Until night.[3-]Don't sleep.
Descend into this area?\n[1]Yes.[2-]No.
