You're goin' to take a swing at\nwhittlin' down that big old bamboo\nright there in the middle of the room.\n\nThing is, see, it's a contest to see how\nmany cuts you can make before it hits\nthe ground. If you're good enough,\nyou'll stroll out of here with a prize!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\xFF09You're goin' to take a swing at\nwhittlin' down that big old bamboo\nright there in the middle of the room.\n\nThing is, see, it's a contest to see how\nmany cuts you can make before it hits\nthe ground. If you're good enough,\nyou'll stroll out of here with a prize!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF09It'll cost you <r<10 Rupees >>to see what\nyou're made of. You want to give it\na try?\n[1]You bet! [2-]Not free?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03I got it. You're afraid of sharp objects.\nNot the slicin' type. Come on back if\nyou change your mind!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Whoa! Is that you, Link?\nNever thought I'd run into you here.\n[1]What is this place?[2]Who are you?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Whoa! Is that you, Link?\nNever thought I'd run into you here.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xFF00This here's my secret spot where I come\nto work the kinks out of my sword arm.\n\n\nThere was a time I was the <b<most\npopular guy in all of Skyloft>>. Folks\nwere always cheerin' me on like it was\na parade. But as you know, time passes.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\xFF00And I'm not the young buck I used to\nbe. I eat when I get stressed, and I'm\nworried about my darlin' daughter all\nthe time! I mean, look at this belly!\nSo that's what drives a feller here\nto chop some bamboo! Let me tell you,\nthere's no better way to sweat off\nthose pounds.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700Here's an idea, Link.\nWhy don't you try slicin' some bamboo?\n[1]Sure! [2-]I'll pass.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE00What? You tellin' me you don't know\nwho I am? Believe it or not, I used to be\nthe <b<most popular guy in the sky>>!\nMr. Skyloft, that was me.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x700But\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFBCD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Íyou might relate better if I told\nyou I was the proud father of Skyloft's\nmost popular girl: <b<Peatrice>>, <b<princess\nof the Item Check>>.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x180AHow's that? Does that clear anything\nup for you, young feller? Ha ha ha ha!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\xE06What? You tellin' me you don't know\nwho I am? Believe it or not, I used to be\nthe <b<most popular guy in the sky>>!\nMr. Skyloft, that was me.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\xFF00But\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFBCD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Íyou might relate better if I told\nyou I was the proud father of Skyloft's\nmost popular girl: <b<Peatrice>>, <b<princess\nof the Item Check>>.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x180AHow's that?

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\x60CThat's the spirit! Chop away, boy!\n\n\n\nHold up a second! Get your horses\nholded. There's got to be a way to spice\nthings up a notch or three.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x600Hmm~~.~~.~~.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\x60BYep. That's the ticket right there!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xE05You kiddin' me? Girls don't want to\nhit the town with a wet blanket, son.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\xFF00Not that I want you anywhere near my\nlittle cupcake. No, sir! You lay a finger\non her, and you'll have to buy new\ngloves.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x06Aha! So you're rarin' to go, right?\n[1]You bet![2-]I'll pass.
Your current high score is \x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x01Í!\nYou're going to need your A-game to\ntop that!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x0BSo, what's it gonna be? Want to hack\nsome bamboo? One try will cost you\n<r<10 Rupees>>.\n[1]I'm in![2]Rules?[3-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x700Come on back whenever you feel like\nyou might want to chisel up that\nsword arm!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xE12You're not lightin' any records on\nfire with that score, son. You got to get\nat least <r<15 cuts>>!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\xE00Sharpen up your concentration!\nThere's no prize for sloppy slicin'.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xE05Well, you got miles to go, but I'll give\nyou something for the effort.\nHere's 30 Rupees.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\xFF00Next time around, shoot for <r<20 cuts>>.

Hold up, son, you're all done!\n\n\n\nLet's count those cuts.\nYour score this time is \x0E\x02\x03\x06\x00\x00Í!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xFF06Well, look at that.~~~ Now that I take a\ngander at the thing, it's clear you got\nyourself a stubby little sword.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n You did\nmighty well considering that.\nSee, the longer the sword you got, the\neasier it is to zip through that bamboo\nlike a loaf of warm butter!\n\nIf you get yourself a longer blade in\nthe future, come back and try again.\nYou'll be surprised what a little extra\nsteel can do for your chopping score!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\xE07What seems to be the problem?\nTime's up!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Listen up, pal. I don't want you gettin'\ntoo familiar with my little rainbow.\nAnd you'd better keep your eyes to\nyourself too, if you know what I mean.
