\x0E\x01\x05\x04x\x00\x0E\x00\x03\x02\x06This is a tale that you humans have passed\ndown through uncounted generations...>>
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00It tells of a war of unmatched scale and ferocity,\nthe likes of which would never be seen again.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00One dark, fateful day, the earth cracked wide and\nmalevolent forces rushed forth from the fissure.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00They mounted a brutal assault upon the surface\npeople, driving the land into deep despair...
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00They burnt forests to ash, choked the land's sweet\nsprings, and murdered without hesitation.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00They did all this in their lust to take the <r<ultimate\npower>> protected by Her Grace, the goddess.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00The power she guarded was without equal.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00Handed down by gods of old, this power gave its\nholder the means to make any desire a reality.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00Such was the might of the ultimate power that\nthe old ones placed it in the care of the goddess.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00To prevent this great power from falling into\nthe hands of the evil swarming the lands...
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00The goddess gathered the surviving humans\non an outcropping of earth.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00She sent it skyward, beyond the reach of the\ndemonic hordes. Beyond even the clouds.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00With the humans safe, the goddess joined forces with the\nland dwellers and fought the evil forces, sealing them away.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00At last, peace was restored to the surface.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04d\x00This is a tale that you humans have told for\nmany ages, generation to generation...
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00But there are other legends, long hidden away from\nmemory, that are intertwined with this tale.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00Now, a new legend bound to this great story \nstands ready to be revealed.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00A legend that will be forged by your own hand.
Rise, <b<\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x03Link>>...\nThe time has come for you to awaken...
You are fated to have a hand in a great\ndestiny, and it will soon find you...\n\n\nThe time has come for you to awaken...\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00\n\n\n\n<b<\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0D>>\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link...\x0E\x01\x05\x04-\x00
Hey, sleepyhead. I know how much you\nlike to sleep in, so I'm guessing this\nletter will be your alarm clock this\nmorning. \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Did I guess right?\nRise and shine, <b<Link>>!\nToday's the <r<Wing Ceremony>>!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDYou promised to meet me before it\nstarts,~~~ remember?\nYou'd better not keep me waiting.\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E-<b<Zelda>>
<y+<\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFCCDOh youth, guided by the servant of the\ngoddess... Unite earth and sky...\nBring light to the land...>>\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í\x0E\x01\x05\x04U\x00
Hey! Good morning, <b<Link>>.
I'm glad to see my <r<Loftwing >>got you out\nof bed.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI was pretty sure you'd sleep in and\nforget to meet me this morning.
But look at this instrument! And look\nat this outfit! They're mine to use today\nin the <r<ceremony>>, since I'll be playing\nthe role of the goddess.
Aren't they beautiful? Especially this \ninstrument! They tell me it's just like \nthe one the goddess was said to have in\nthe legends.\nIt sounds gorgeous too. I asked <b<Father\n>>about it, and he says it's called a <b<harp>>.
And look at these clothes! I made this\nwrap myself, and we get to use it in\ntoday's ceremony!\n\nBetween the harp and this outfit, I'm\ngoing to make a great goddess today!\n\n\nI got you up early this morning because\nI wanted you to be the first to see me\nlike this, \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Link!
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x1CDSo...how do I look?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\n[1]Great! [2]Uh...[3]Nice...costume.
Hah, I think so too! But it's nice to\nknow you agree. Thanks,\nLink.
Really\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...?\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í You know\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Ímaybe it does\nlook a little weird...
And what exactly is THAT supposed to\nmean, you goof? If you think I look\nsilly, just come out and say it.
Ah, there you are, <b<Zelda>>. Are you all\nprepared for today's ceremony?
Oh, hello, <b<Father>>.
Ah, Link, you're here too. \nOutstanding.\n\n\nIt's encouraging to see you up so early,\ngiven your capacity for sleep. No doubt\ntoday's ceremony had you too excited\nto close your eyes for once!
If you win today's ceremonial race,\nyou'll get to participate in the \npostrace ritual with Zelda, so give it\nyour best out there.
Yes. About that\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...
Father, I don't know if he can do it!\n\n\n\nRecently Link hasn't\nbeen practicing much at all\nfor the ceremony!
And even when he's out riding his\nLoftwing, he's just lazily gliding\naround. Probably daydreaming!\n\nI don't know what he's thinking. \nHe's going to have to be in perfect \ncontrol of his bird to win today.
No need to worry yourself, Zelda.\n\n\n\nThough you may have a point. \nToday's <r<Wing Ceremony >>tests the skill\nof the rider as well as his bond to his\nbird. Victory will not come easily.
And, as you pointed out, I haven't seen\nhim practicing as hard as some of the\nother students.\n\nBut you've known him since you were\nboth very little. You should know better\nthan to fret about him!\n\nYou see, Link and his\nLoftwing share a special connection. \nI've never seen anything quite like it.
As you know, each of us in Skyloft is\nbut one half of a pair.\n\n\nWe are only made whole by our\nLoftwings, the <r<guardian birds >>that \nthe goddess bestows upon each of us\nas a symbol of her divine protection.
When we are young, every one of us \nmeets our Loftwing under the great\nStatue of the Goddess. It's quite a big\nmoment, as I'm sure you recall.
Ahh, but that first meeting between\nLink and his Loftwing was\nextraordinary.\n\nThe bird that came to him was a\n<r<Crimson Loftwing>>. It is a breed so rare\nwe were sure for some time that it had\nvanished from the line.
Yes, and the boy and his bird seemed\nto share a profound connection from\nthe moment they met.\n\nDo you recall seeing Link \nand that Loftwing of his when they first\nmet? What a sight!\n\nThe little boy just hopped up on that\nbird and gracefully flew away, without\neven a moment of instruction!\nThey were meant for each other.\nAnd judging by how jealous you were\nthat day, I'd say the friendship he\nshared with his bird didn't go unnoticed\nby you, my dear.
Ah, but who can blame you? I'm sure\nyou weren't the only one envious of\nthe powerful bond shared by\nLink and his bird.\nAnyone who is a part of something\nspecial is bound to catch some nasty\nlooks sooner or later, hoo hoo.
This contest is nothing to laugh at,\nFather! This ceremony is part of the\nfinal test for those training to become \nknights of Skyloft!
If Link doesn't fly fast\nenough during the race... 
What if Link messes up\nhis big chance\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í~~~ What if he's not\nallowed to become a knight?
Calm down, my dear. It will be fine.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's almost as though you\nbecome a completely different person\nwhen you worry about\nLink.
Listen, Link, you'd better\nfly your heart out today. At the very\nleast, you need to squeeze in a little\npractice time before the race!
Come on! You'll thank me later!
Here we are. Go on now. Jump off \nthe edge and call your Loftwing. \nIt's almost time for the ceremony,\nso try to practice seriously for once!\nHmm? ~~~Oh yeah?~~~ You can't \x201Csense\"\nyour bird out there?\n\n\nOh, I get it. You're trying to weasel out\nof having to practice! Nice try, but\nyou're not fooling me.
Off you go!\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x1E\x00
OK, Link, go ahead!\nJust <g<press >>(v) and call your Loftwing!\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
Hmm...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E His bird sure is taking a long\ntime to get here...\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
Something's wrong!\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x1E\x00
Hang in there, Link!\nI've got you!\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x1E\x00
Are you two all right?\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
I'm sorry, friend. I didn't mean to push\nyou so hard. You didn't sprain your\nwing, did you?
This is very odd, Link.\nWhat could have possibly happened to\nyour Loftwing?\n\nFor a bird to ignore the call of his\nmaster... It's unheard of!
And you still can't sense your bird\nnearby, eh, Link?\n\n\nThis is quite a problem, especially\nconsidering the <r<Wing Ceremony >>is\nabout to start...
\x0E\x01\x08\x02Í\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, when you said you\ncouldn't sense your Loftwing, well...\nI should have believed you.\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD\n...\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍI'm sorry.
I need to tend to my own Loftwing, so\nI'll catch up with you later.\n\n\nYou'd better go on ahead and see if you\ncan find where your bird has gone!
My, how did it get to be so late?\nIf I recall correctly, this year \n<b<Instructor Horwell>> is presiding over \nthe <r<ceremony>>. \n\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, you should go\nexplain the situation to him and see if\nhe's willing to delay the race a little\nso that you can find your bird.
But, Father, you're the <r<headmaster >>of\nthe academy! If Link asks\n<b<Instructor Horwell>>, he'll probably\njust come talk to you about it.
Ah, quite true. As usual, you make an\nexcellent point, my dear.\n\n\nVery well, I'll explain the situation\nto him myself. \x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, run\nalong and tell Instructor Horwell\nto come see me in my quarters.
...You know, <b<Groose>>, that sure was a\npain, what with all the scratching and\npecking.
Course it was. You thought a big\n<r<Crimson Loftwing>> like that was\ngonna go down without a fight?
But we got him, and I don't care how\ntough those birds are supposed to be.\nHe's not getting out of that pen\nanytime soon, boys.
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDWhoa!\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02Í\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link! So, uh...yeah.\nJust how long you been standing there?
What's your problem, anyway?\nOh, wait...I got it. You're here to talk\nabout today's <r<race>>. I can see it in those\ndopey eyes of yours.\nThey're pleading, \x201C\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDOh, Groose, can you\nplease find it in your heart to let me\nwin today? Please!\"\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í\n\nYou're just desperate to win so you can\nget some <r<alone time >>with Zelda up on\nthe <r<Statue of the Goddess >>at the end of\nthe ceremony.
Well, sorry, pal. Groose doesn't do\ncharity for wimps. My advice? Work\nhard and wish with all your heart.\nYou might even come in second.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD...Say, come to think of it, how come I\ndon't see your bird?~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í Where is that\nscruffy pile of red feathers?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14
I can't imagine what could've happened\nto him. Do you think his tiny brain got\nconfused by all the clouds and got lost?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\n[1]Bring it on.[2]Give him back![3]Nice hair.
Pfft. Sure. Only thing is, I don't know\nhow you're going to do that with no\nbird! You gonna grow wings?
Huh? I've got no idea what you're\ntalking about.
You lay off my do right now, or I'll\nflatten you. Everyone knows I've\ngot the slickest pompadour in town.
You know, we're all getting tired of\nhow you never let anyone forget you\nand Zelda <r<go way back>>.
You've been friends since you were\nkids? Big deal. It doesn't change the\nfact that you float through life with\nyour head in the clouds.
Would you wake up, straighten up,\nand grow a backbone already?
Dopes like you are dragging our\nhonored academy through the mud.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDAnd just who might you be talking\nabout, Groose?
Oh...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EZelda. Hey. Nah, it's...uh...\n
Don't even try it, Groose! You're\npicking on Link again,\naren't you?
He's a student at the academy,\nlike all of us.
Why do you insist on bullying him\naround so much?
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDYeah... I suppose...
You suppose? Suppose what?
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDI...suppose...you... Er...
Pfft! Forget it. I wasn't supposing\nanything, OK?
OK, we're outta here, boys.\nLater, Link!\nHope you find your bird, or else you're\ngonna have to sit out today's race!
That could be a major setback toward\nknighthood, so find that bird or get\nreal used to the taste of failure! \nIt's your special flavor.
I hate to say it, but I'm beginning to \nsuspect that those blockheads had \nsomething to do with your Loftwing's\ndisappearance.\n\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, those guys aren't\ngoing to help us find your bird,\nso we'd better start searching.
I'll fly around Skyloft and see if I can\nspot any trace of your bird.
Father said he'd talk to Instructor\nHorwell about delaying the start of the\nWing Ceremony, so don't worry. \nWe'll find your bird in time.
We should hurry, Link.\nNow that your Loftwing is free, you\nshould fly to the <r<ceremony>>\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD...
But before you go, I have to ask you\nsomething. I\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍI heard this voice a few\nmoments ago. Did you hear it too?
It's been happening a lot lately. It's the\nstrangest feeling... Almost like\nsomeone is calling out to me.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Have you ever wondered what's\nbeneath the clouds?\n\n\nSome say that it's an empty, barren\nplace, or even that there's nothing at\nall down below, but I just have this\nfeeling that they're wrong.\nSome of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the surface. The old\ntales describe a whole world under\nthere, far more vast than <r<Skyloft>>!\nThe thing is, no one's ever been down\nthere to see it, and our Loftwings won't\nfly through the cloud barrier.\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍBut I can't help imagining the wild\nthings that might be waiting below.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\nSomeday, I want to see for myself.
Oh, sorry, Link. We don't\nhave time to talk! Let's get going.\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Look, your bird's waiting for you!\n\nJust leap off the edge and <g<press >>(v).\nDon't worry about falling. Your bird \nwill catch you for sure this time!\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD



\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link!
Don't worry--I'm fine!
Great flying, Link!\nCongratulations!
Now we'd better get on with the\nceremony!\x0E\x01\x05\x04´\x00
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, hand me that Bird\nStatuette you grabbed in the race.~~~\nI must offer it to the goddess.
Great goddess, guiding light and\nprotector of our people, grant us your\nblessing and mercy as I act in your\nstead during this ceremony.
<y+<Valiant youth>><y+< who grasped victory at\nthe celebration of the bird folk...\nIn accordance with the old ways...\n\n<y+<I now bestow the blessings of the\ngoddess upon you.<y+<>>
<y+<The blessings of the goddess drift down\nfrom the heavens aloft a sail, which I\nnow pass on to you.>>
You got the <y<Sailcloth>>!\n\n\n\nNow you can jump from any height without\nfear of a painful landing!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFDCD...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14It smells nice too.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link! Quit goofing\naround. This is supposed to be a\nsacred ritual, remember?
You know, they say that the goddess\ngave the Sailcloth to her <r<chosen hero\n>>long ago.\n\nOf course, the one you're holding isn't\nthe same one. I've been working hard to\nfinish making this Sailcloth in time to\ngive it to today's champion.\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI'm really glad I got to give it to you,\nLink.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍTake care of it, OK?
Thanks for making it up here to do this\nwith me today like you promised,\nLink.
Now we really should finish up this\nritual...\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDYou...~~~do know what happens at the\nend, right?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E \n\n\n[1]Nope.[2]Uh-oh...[3]Sort of...
Really? Huh. I thought you would've\nfigured it out by now.
And just what are you thinking?\nDon't be silly. This is your big moment,\nLink.
Heehee, I'm glad you're so well \ninformed on the subject.
You have to jump off the statue!\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
Look down. See that <r<big>>, <r<round design>>\non the courtyard below?\n\n\nTo finish the ceremony, you need to\ndrop down right into the center of it!\n\n\nLeap off the edge here. Right before\nyou hit the ground, press (B) to open up\nyour <y<Sailcloth>>!\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x1CD\n\nJust how brave are you? If you were\nreally fearless, you'd wait until the\nlast second to use your Sailcloth.\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...So,\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í ready to jump?
That was perfect! You're amazing,\nLink!
You know, Link, seeing as\nhow you won today...
And with the weather being so nice...
You think maybe you'd like to, ~~~you\nknow, go fly around the clouds\ntogether?
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD...\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link?\nHey, Link!
Today was amazing. Watching you win\nthe race and performing the ritual\ntogether... I'll always remember this.
It really was wonderful.
You know... Link...
There's something I've been meaning to\ntalk to you about...
What is that?
What's going on?
Ahhh! \x0E\x03\x01\x00Link!\x0E\x01\x05\x04-\x00
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0D\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link...?
I am waiting for you.\n\n\n\nThe time has come for you to awaken.\n\n\n\nYou are vital to a mission of great\nimportance.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0D\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link...
...Ah, you're awake.
When your Loftwing carried you back,\nyou were limp and unconscious.\nI feared the worst.\n\nFortunately, you don't appear to have\nany serious injuries. For that much\nwe can be grateful.
But, Link...\nWhere's Zelda?\nShe was with you, was she not?\n\n~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD...~~~What's happened to my daughter?
A black tornado, you say? Hmm.\nThat was no ordinary storm.
You must not push yourself.\nYou're still recovering.\n\n\nTell me, when you saw Zelda today,\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\ndid anything about her seem...off?
I see. She was talking about the\n<r<surface >>then?\n\n\nAnd you've been having dreams about\na \x201Cgreat mission\"? How interesting...
I'm sorry. I was lost in thought there\nfor a moment. It's all very strange, but\nI doubt there's much of a connection\nbetween these things.\nI'm concerned for Zelda, but so long\nas she's with her Loftwing, I'm sure\nshe'll be fine.\n\nEither way, daybreak has yet to arrive.\nIt would be very difficult to spot one\ngirl and her bird in the dark of night.\nIt would also be very dangerous.

Rest now, Link.\nZelda's going to be fine. She's out\nthere alive. I know it.
The one chosen by my creator.\nI have been waiting for you.\nYou will play a role in a great destiny.
According to your social customs,\nI should provide you with my personal\ndesignation. <b<Fi>> is the name I was given.\n\nI was created for a single purpose,\nlong before the recorded memory of \nyour people.\n\nI must aid you in fulfilling the great\ndestiny that is your burden to carry.
Come, Link.\nYou must take up this sword. As the\none chosen by my creator, it is your\ndestiny.
The strange dreams troubling your\nsleep.~~~ My sudden appearance.~~~\nUncertainty surrounding the fate of\none you hold dear.~~~\nUnder the circumstances, it is only\nlogical that you would exhibit some \napprehension.
To minimize your uncertainty, allow\nme to share some information.\n\n\nMy projections indicate that this\ninformation has a high probability of\naltering your current emotional state.
The one you seek, honorable <b<Zelda>>,\nis still alive.
And this spirit maiden\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02Íthe one you\ncall Zelda...is another chosen one fated\nto be part of the same great mission.\n\nTherefore, should you wish to meet\nwith your friend, I highly recommend\nyou take up this sword before you\nset out to search for her.
Does that information invigorate you?\nAre you ready to accept this sword?
It seems that further persuasive\nmeasures will not be required.\n\n\nIn the name of my creator, draw the\nsword and raise it skyward.
Recognition complete, ~~~\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link... ~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDMy \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04master.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link!
I've had my suspicions, but until now I\nwasn't sure.\n\n\nYet here we are in the<r< Chamber of the\nSword>>, the very place where it was\nforetold the youth of legend would one\nday appear.
It is said that this place was left to our\npeople by the goddess herself.\n\n\nThe very knowledge of this room's\nexistence is a secret passed down to a \nselect few each generation, along with\na handful of words...
<y+<When the light of the goddess's sword\nshines bright, the great apocalypse\nwill wake from its long slumber.\n\n<y+<Do not fear, for it is then that a youth,\nguided by my hand, shall reveal himself\nin a place most sacred.<y+<>>
It started days ago. The sword that I've\nkept secret all these years... It began to\ngive off a faint, otherworldly light.
At first I was sure I was seeing things,\nhere alone with the sword. There was\nsimply no other explanation.\n\nI never dreamed the prophecy of\nlegend would come to pass in my\nlifetime.
The words I have sworn to keep secret\nare coming true before my very eyes.\n\n\n<y+<The youth will be guided by one born\nof the blade--one who is also youthful \nin likeness yet wise with knowledge\nimmeasurable.>>
Oral tradition, one of the least\nreliable methods of information\nretention and transmission.\n\nIt appears that critical sections of the\npassage have been lost over the\ngenerations.
<y+<The youth who draws forth the guiding\nsword shall be known as the goddess's\nchosen hero, and it is he who possesses\nan unbreakable spirit.\n<y+<He shall be burdened with the task of\nabolishing the shadow of apocalypse\nfrom the land. Such is his destiny.<y+<\n\n<y+<With the spirit of the blade at his side,\nhe shall soar over the clouds and\nplummet below...<y+<\n\n<y+<...And united with the spirit maiden,\nshall bring forth a piercing light that\nresurrects the land.<y+<>>
Some of Father's old texts talk about a\nplace called the <r<surface>>.\n\n\nThe old tales describe a whole world\ndown there, far more vast than <r<Skyloft>>!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, you must embark on a great\njourney beneath the clouds to the vast\nrealm of the <r<surface>>.\n\nIt is only through this journey that you\ncan fulfill the mission set before you\nby my creator, the goddess.\n\nIt is also the only method available for\nyou to reunite with the spirit maiden,\nhonorable Zelda.
This is no easy task, Link.\nThe world below is a forsaken place,\nand to reach it you must pierce the \ncloud barrier below.\nIn living memory, no one has ever\ndone this.
This tablet will illuminate a path\nthrough the clouds to the land below.\n\n\nTake it, and place it within the altar\nbehind me.
You got the <y<Emerald Tablet>>!\nThe weathered surface of this heavy stone\ntablet feels very old.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, the first thing you must\ndo is hit the crest sitting in this\nroom with a <r<Skyward Strike>>.\n\nThese blasts are formed of pure energy\nthat charges within your blade when\nyou lift it skyward.\n\nOnce you have charged your blade,\nface the crest and swing your sword\nto send out a powerful Skyward Strike.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, it is done.
Until now, a <r<cloud >><r<barrier >>created by\nthe goddess has separated the world\nyou know from the one below.\n\nThe tablet you placed in the altar has\nopened a small rift in the cloud barrier.\nYou can use it to travel through the\nclouds to the realm below.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02I have recognized you as my master,\nand so it is my duty to follow you\nwherever you may go.\n\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02I reside within your sword and will\naccompany you in your travels. \n<g<Press >>(v) to summon me whenever you\nrequire my assistance.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, listen a moment.\nThe nature of the great apocalypse \nmentioned in the old texts is a complete\nmystery to me.\nBut whatever it turns out to be, it seems\nthat both you and Zelda have big roles\nto play in the destiny of this land.\n\nJust think--if what this Fi says is true,\nZelda is alive! Alive and no doubt\ncoming to terms with whatever it is the\ngoddess has in store for her.\nShould you heed the call of destiny,\nI don't know what dangers you may\nhave to face, Link.\nEspecially down there...\nBut if you've decided to brave the\nunknown, please find my daughter and\nbring her back to me.
What we've seen here today defies\nexplanation, but it is only the start of\nyour journey. Please, see it through\nand prove the legends true.\n[1]OK![2]No way.[3]It's so much...
You do your people proud,\nLink!
I understand how you feel, but this is \ndestiny itself calling for you. You must\nnot run from it, Link!
Ah... I'm sorry, Link.\nI know it's a heavy load to shoulder,\nbut you're the only one who can bear\nits weight.
Dawn is drawing near. It has been a\nlong night for the both of us, hasn't it?\n\n\nYou have a great journey before you,\nLink, and those clothes...\nThey don't look up to the task.\n\nThe uniform you were to receive for\nwinning the race should be ready\nby now.\n\nA sturdy uniform like that will prove\nmuch more suitable for a long journey.\nYou'd better change before you go.
That green uniform is what our knights\nwill be wearing this year. To be honest,\nI've had my doubts about the color.\n\nBut oddly enough, seeing you wear this\nuniform, I can't imagine a more fitting\ncolor for you. It's as though you were\nborn to wear it.
Take care on your journey, and be sure\nto stop by some of the shops at the\nbazaar here in town to equip yourself\nproperly for the travels ahead.\nI will return to my quarters and see if\nI can glean more useful information\nfrom the ancient texts.\n\nYou are always welcome to stop by if\nyou have questions. You and Zelda shall\nbe in my prayers. May the goddess \nwatch over and guide you both.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the <b<goddess >>awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01The goddess intended this message for\nyou, Master. These are her words.
<y+<He who seeks the <b<sacred flames<y+<, listen\nwell, for I guide you from my place at\nthe edge of time.>>
<y+<The <b<sacred flames <y+<are three in number.\nTo obtain them, you must also earn\nrelics known as the <b<three sacred gifts<y+<.\n\n<y+<For each <r<trial<y+< you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with one of the gifts...<y+<>>
<y+<Make use of the power of these gifts,\nand you will find your way to the \npurifying <b<sacred flames<y+<.\n\n<y+<Now, I bestow unto you a melody.\nIt will serve you as a key, opening the\nfirst trial that awaits you deep in the\nwilds of <y+<<r<Faron Woods<y+<.>>
That song is called Farore's Courage.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Its rousing melody will guide you.
You learned <y<Farore's Courage>>!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, you must overcome the <r<trials\n>>set before you and obtain the three\ngifts to reach the sacred flames.\n\nI have committed Farore's Courage\nto memory. Now you can use your\n<r<dowsing >>ability to search for the <b<gate>>\nleading to the first trial you must face.\nI suggest you set out for <b<Faron Woods\n>>as soon as you are ready.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the <b<goddess >>awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01The goddess intended this message for\nyou, Master. These are her words.
<y+<He who seeks the <b<sacred flames<y+<, listen\nwell, for I am the one guiding you from\nmy place at the edge of time.>>
<y+<Two>> <y+<<b<sacred flames<y+< remain. Should you\ndesire to possess them, you must obtain\nthe other <b<sacred gifts<y+<.\n\n<y+<For each <r<trial<y+< you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with another gift.<y+<>>
<y+<Harness the power of these gifts, and\nlet there be no doubt you shall find\nyourself standing before the majesty\nof the <b<sacred flames<y+<.\n<y+<Now, I give you another melody. It will\nserve as a key to unlocking your next\ntrial, which awaits you within the\nshifting sands of <r<Lanayru Desert<y+<<y+<>><y+<.>>
The song you just heard is called\n<b<Nayru's Wisdom>>. \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Use this song of\nknowledge to find the next trial.
You learned <y<Nayru's Wisdom>>!
I have memorized Nayru's Wisdom for\nyou. You can now use <r<dowsing >>to\nlocate the <b<gate >>to the next trial.\n\nYou should set a course for <b<Lanayru\nDesert >>immediately.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I have\nimportant information.\n\n\nWhen you struck the crest with a \nSkyward Strike from your sword, a \nmessage from the <b<goddess >>awakened \ndeep within my memory.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01The goddess intended this message\nfor you, Master. These are her words.
<y+<He who seeks the <b<sacred flames<y+<, listen\nwell, for I am the one guiding you from\nmy place at the edge of time.>>
<y+<The last of the>> <y+<<b<sacred flames<y+< still\neludes you. To obtain it, you must claim\nanother <b<sacred <y+<gift.\n\n<y+<For each <r<trial<y+< you overcome, you shall\nbe blessed with another gift.<y+<>>
<y+<Make use of the power of these gifts,\nand you will most certainly find the\npath to the <b<sacred flames<y+<.\n\n<y+<Now, I bestow unto you another\nmelody. Let it serve as a key to\nunlocking your final trial. It awaits you\nupon <r<Eldin Volcano<y+<<y+<>><y+<.>>
According to my records, that song you\njust heard is called <b<Din's Power>>.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Use this song of might to locate the\nlast trial.
You learned <y<Din's Power>>!
I have committed Din's Power to my\nmemory. Now you have the ability to\nuse <r<dowsing >>to locate the <b<gate >>to the\nfinal trial.\nI suggest you travel to <b<Eldin Volcano>>.

Bahah! So you've learned all three\nparts of the song from the dragons,\neh? You have done well, young one!
True to my word, I will perform the\nlast part of the song for you. Ahem...
You learned the <y<final part of the\nSong of the Hero>>\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n.~~~.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14.\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
The <y<Song of the Hero>> is now complete!
Now that you know the song, I trust you\nknow what to do with it. That old song\nopens a door to a great <b<trial>>.\n\nShould you succeed in conquering the\nchallenge awaiting you there, I'm \ncertain the path to the <y+<Triforce >>will be\nrevealed to you.

A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link.\nMy calculations indicate an 85% chance\nthat the structure you uncovered\nhouses the <y+<Triforce>>.\nGiven this development, I project that\nthe moment for Zelda to fulfill her\ndestiny and bring an end to <b<Demise>> is\nclose at hand.

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I believe at this juncture that\na prayer is required. ~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDThe ultimate goal\nwe have traveled so far for is now\nwithin reach.\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDFocus now, and wish with all your might\nfor the <r<destruction>> of <b<Demise>>.
