\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I require your confirmation.\nYou are currently attempting to\nascertain the location of <r<Zelda>>.\n\nAre you familiar with how to use\n<r<dowsing >>to search for Zelda?\n[1]Of course! [2]I forgot...
\x0E\x01\x05\x04K\x00\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, this is <b<Eldin Volcano>>. It is an\nactive volcano rich with the power\nof the earth.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00Approximately 65% of the region is\ncovered by lava. It is inhabited by a\nlarge number of creatures that thrive\nin the extreme heat and direct flame.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00Please exercise caution with flammable\nmaterials such as <r<wood >>and <r<fabric>>.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04K\x00In the event you catch on fire, I highly\nrecommend you extinguish the flames\nby performing a<g< forward roll>> or a <g<spin\nattack>>.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I require\nyour confirmation on critical\ninformation obtained from that\n<b<Mogma >>conversation.\nThe<r< oddly garbed figure >>taken deeper\ninto the region must be...\n[1]Zelda! [2]Woman in black?
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05My calculations agree, Master. \nThere is a 90% probability the figure in\nquestion was indeed Zelda.
The woman in black? The probability\nof your assessment being correct\nis...\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD10%. \x0E\x01\x08\x02ÍRounded up.\n\nI conclude the subject was likely\n<r<Zelda>>.
Additionally, I calculate there is a 95%\nprobability that the key to this door is\nmade of the same material composition\nas this mechanism that bars it. 
I have detected objects of the same\nmaterial in the surrounding area.\n\n\nAscertaining the location of these\nobjects will aid in our search for\n<r<Zelda>>. I have registered them as\n<r<dowsing >>targets.<pling>
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Of course you do. My apologies. Please\ncontinue your search for Zelda.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Understood, Master. To begin <r<dowsing>>,\npress and hold (C).\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x6CD\n\n\nUse the Wii Remote to select a dowsing\ntarget. You will be able to sense the\ntarget through the tip of your sword.\n\nThe closer you get to the target, the\n<r<stronger the sword's reaction will\nbecome>>. You will be alerted with a\nvibration and audible cue.\nYou may also use the <r<cursor >>to gauge\nan accurate direction of the target's\nlocation.\n\nPlease select Zelda as your dowsing\ntarget and commence your search.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I am detecting<r< extremely high\ntemperatures >>from the area directly\nahead.\n\nI calculate a 95% chance your clothing\nwill immediately combust upon\nentrance. Please proceed with caution. \n\nYou may be able to pass through safely\nif you<g< run>>. I recommend confirming\nyour direction by <r<dowsing >>before\nmaking the attempt.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I am detecting<r< extremely high\ntemperatures>> from the area ahead.\nYou will not survive this environment\nwith your \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02heart total.\nAdditionally, <r<dowsing >>results do not\nsupport this path. Please reconfirm\nthe correct direction to proceed.
Master, I am detecting <r<extremely high\ntemperatures>> from the area directly\nahead.\n\nYou will not survive this environment\nwith your current \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02heart total.\nI recommend you turn back.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, the abilities of your sword have\nincreased. It is now possible to <r<dowse\n>>for <y<Rupees>>.\n\nI have registered <y<Rupees >>as a viable\n<r<dowsing>> target. <pling>Use this exciting new\nfeature as you deem necessary.
Whoa! Now there's a green one!
One of your people just came charging\nthrough here. <r<Dressed all in black>>!\nThat a friend of yours?<pling>
See that up ahead? That's what we call\na drop-dead dead end, but this\ncharacter danced right over it.
Seriously? Jumping over a gap like\nthat? ~~~My jaw hit the dirt.
The mountains ahead are crawling with\nthose red troublemakers, but...\n\n\nI got a feeling that shady so-and-so is\ngonna zip right on by 'em.\n\n\nCan you imagine treasure hunting with\nsomeone who could do that? \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x2FFYou got\nyourself some good friends, don'tcha?
Grrr... Those creeps just shimmied on\nin and took over our territory.
Yeow! What're you doing? Don't be\nsneakin' up on me like that!\n\n\nHuh? You're looking for your friend?\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x12FF\nCan't help you there. \x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFFNobody's come\nthrough here, so...\x0E\x01\n\x04\x09Í\n\nMaybe they went up the mountain\nfrom over thataway.
Ahh... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Wish someone would chase these\nclowns outta here.
Now there's an idea! Why don'tcha\nmake yourself useful and get rid of\n'em? \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1209Yeah, like that's gonna happen...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x80EWhat's that? You really sent those\ncreeps packing?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1200Well, seems like they're extra mad at\nyou, so... Guess it's only natural that\nyou had to handle things.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00But did you notice when you start\nwhittling 'em down, they call in\nreinforcements with that <r<horn>>?\nThat ain't a fair fight, if you ask me.\nI bet the horn blower in the <r<blue cap>><pling>\nis the leader.
When that creep in the <r<blue hat >>blows\nhis horn, it starts a bad-guy stampede.\nWhat're you gonna do about it?
Whoa... ~~~You took out every last one\nof 'em...~~~
You're one tough customer! Thanks for\nall your help!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF0BI don't blame you for not knowing\nthis, but us <b<Mogmas >>always honor our\ndebts. Let me give you something to\nprove it. Any special requests?\n[1]A way forward.[2]Rupees!
Oh, right. You're trying to find your\nfriend, aren'tcha?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x809In that case, take these things!\nThey're something pretty special, if I\nsay so myself.
Huh? Rupees? Is that really what\nyou're after?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1204\x0E\x01\x08\x02\xFFCDI mean, it's his reward and all, but...really?\nJust Rupees? Seems like a waste of a reward\nopportunity to me. And I don't even have any.\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Oh wait, I know. I got something good instead.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x12FFSo, hey...uh...~~~I don't exactly have any\nRupees on me...\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x809But I got something better! Didn't you\nsay you were looking for a friend?\nWell, I got something that can help you\nreach this friend... Take these instead!
With these, you should be able to get to\nthe top of that ledge right behind me.\x0E\x01\n\x04\x0BÍ\nJust try digging in that hole below the\nledge. You're in for a surprise!
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\xFFCDIt's not like I'm using these things, you know?\nAnd they're WAY better than Rupees!
I just hope your friend hasn't been\ncaptured by those red guys. Here's\nhoping everything's OK.
Hey, I'm hoping you find your friend\nall in one piece!
Hmm... I'm sure they buried it around\nhere someplace, but I can't find it.
Yo, <b<Ledd>>! This is the place, ain't it?\nSo what is it they buried again?
A <r<key>>! <r<K-E-Y>>, <r<KEY>>!
They busted up the <r<key to that door >>and\nhid the pieces all over the place.\n\n\nI'm telling you, one of the <r<five pieces >>is\nburied right around here.
Hey, that reminds me... That<r< strange\nblonde girl in the weird clothes >><pling>got\ntaken away too.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1011\xD0BThat's right! I bet they got something\nreally valuable stashed in there.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1009\x800And that blonde girl they took is\nprobably part of their master plan too.\nI'm telling you, I can smell the riches\nfrom here!
So what're you saying we do once we\nfind all the pieces to the key?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1011\xD09Whaddya think, igneous? We sneak\ninside and take all the treasure we\ncan carry!
Hey...~~~ Why are we so worried about a\nkey when we can just dig our way in?
What? Um...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E
Just sayin'.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E
You ain't as dumb as you look!
Hey! Hey! HEY! Y-you mess with our\nturf and you're gonna...pay?
Whoa! You're not...~~~ Yo, <b<Ledd>>, I don't\nthink this is one of those red creeps.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x800Y-y-yeah, I think you're right...\nNo reason to scare the hair off us,\nthough!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xD01Sorry 'bout that, pal. These monsters\nshowing up and messing with our\nturf has got me on edge.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x800They show up here, and I'm gonna\nknock the red clean out of 'em!\nThat's what I'm doing here.\nYeah, me, <b<Ledd>>.
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\xFFCDYeah, whatever, Mr. Too Scared to Dig in\nthe Dark.
Anyway, if you're looking for treasure,\nyou should stay clear of those red guys.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xD11Huh? You're looking for a friend?\nNOT treasure?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF0ESo that must have been your pal that\npassed by earlier, <r<sprinting by >>without\nso much as a glance in this direction.<pling>\n\nIt was sorta a blur of movement, so I\ndidn't get a real good look, but I knew\nit wasn't one of those red creeps.\n\nYour pal must have gone straight up\nhere, so why don't you follow?
Us <b<Mogmas >>have claimed this territory\nto search around for riches. We're\nwhat you'd call <b<treasure hunters>>.\n\nThere are loads of these red, blue, and\ngreen stones called <y<Rupees >>around\nhere. Sometimes you can even find\n<r<silver >>and<r< gold >>ones too.\nAnd while they ain't technically\ntreasure, you can also find these tough\n<r<mineral chunks>>. I bet you could <r<use 'em\nto make stuff>>.\nSince you're here and all, you might as\nwell look around, right?
The one that went running through\nhere looked kinda like you.\n\n\nI don't think he was dressed in green,\nthough.

Gyaah! Sneak attack!\n\n\n\nWait... You ain't one of those red guys.\n~~~\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1009\x807Don't creep up on me like that!\nAlmost had to tackle ya there.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x100A\xFF00Didn't mean to yell at ya, but those red\njerks moved in and have been stinking\nup our turf, ya know?
They came up through that hole back\nthere, so I sunk the road leading to it\nin lava. That'll stop more of 'em\nfrom moving in, I'd say.
Of course, we can tunnel underneath\nit, so it's no sweat for us.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1011\x80BPretty clever, right?
So stay away from the plug that's\nholding back the lava. It'll do more\nthan singe your brows off. Bye now!
Gyaah! Sneak attack! Hey, where'd all\nthe lava go? Now the road's open\nagain! You won't get away with this!
Whoa! You scared me silly! \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xD00You can't\njust start digging right above my head,\nyou know?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x809But I get where you're coming from.\nYou never know what you're going to\nfind when you dig, so it's impossible to\nstop!\n<r<\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFFRupees >>are the most common treasure\nyou'll dig up, but sometimes you might\neven score <r<Eldin Ore>> or some <r<hearts>>!\n\nSo if you run across a hole and you've\ngot the time, dig, dig, dig!
Whoa! You scared me silly! \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xD00You can't\njust start digging right above my head,\nyou know?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x809But I get where you're coming from.\nYou never know what you're going to\nfind when you dig. That's what makes\nit so impossible to stop!\n<r<\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFFRupees >>are the most common thing\nyou'll dig up, but you might get some\n<r<Eldin Ore >>as well!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xD11Used to be plenty of hearts buried down\nhere too, but weirdly enough I haven't\nseen any recently. Go figure.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFFAnyhow, if you run across a hole and\nyou've got the time, dig, dig, dig!
Oh, hey! Sometimes these<r< red, blobby\nthings >>will pop out too. Disgusting!\nBe careful not to let 'em grab you.
Hey, you! You're gonna try your mitts\nat <b<Tubert's >><r<Thrill Digger >>game, right?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x80BPssst. You want some <r<top-secret info>>?\nIt's guaranteed to make you rich!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00R-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nI-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nC-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nH\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n.\n\nNow since you'll be lining your pockets\nwith Rupees, it's only fair I get a little\npiece of the pie. And I want my pie\nnow, thank you.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x8FFI've got a super-discount price just\nfor you, buddy. How does <r<20 Rupees\n>>sound?\n[1]Deal![2-]No, thanks.
Heh, heh... That's the spirit! Now\nyou've got to promise me this stays\nbetween the two of us. You gotta keep\nyour trap shut. Got it?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xFF00The color of the Rupee you dig up will\ntell you how many bad holes are\naround you.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF0BLike if you dig up a\x0E\x00\x03\x02\x07 green Rupee>>, there\nare <r<no bad holes >>around it!\n\n\nA \x0E\x00\x03\x02\x08blue Rupee >>will have <r<one or two bad\nholes>>. A<r+< red Rupee >>will have<r< three or\nfour>>, and a \x0E\x00\x03\x02\nsilver Rupee>> has got <r<five or\nsix>>.\nIf you're lucky enough to dig up a rare\n\x0E\x00\x03\x02\x0Bgold Rupee>>, there will be <r<seven or eight\nbad holes >>nearby. There are almost no\ngood holes!
What do you think? Makes planning\nwhere to dig a bit easier, don't it?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF09But at the end of the day, it comes down\nto luck. YOUR luck. So just do the\nbest you can, and cross your fingers\nor something.
Why you gotta be such a Rupee\npincher? Fortune's knocking at your\ndoor, pal.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00All right, it's your call. You change\nyour mind, come see me. The info\nwill cost you <r<20 Rupees>>.
You listening? You've gotta remember\nthis. There are <r<no bad holes >>around a\n\x0E\x00\x03\x02\x07green Rupee>>.\n\nA \x0E\x00\x03\x02\x08blue Rupee >>will have <r<one or two bad\nholes >>around it, and a<r+< red Rupee >>will\nhave <r<three or four>>.\n\nA \x0E\x00\x03\x02\nsilver Rupee>> will be surrounded by\n<r<five or six bad holes>> and a \x0E\x00\x03\x02\x0Bgold Rupee\n>>by <r<seven or eight>>. Those are the rules!\n\nThe only thing standing between you\nand being filthy rich is luck. \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x509Here's\nhoping you're luckier than you look.\nHeh heh.
C'mon, pal! You ain't got enough\nRupees.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1209Unless you bring me exactly\n<r<20 Rupees>>, I'm not telling you a thing.
What? You looking to buy what I'm\nselling?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00Secret information on <r<Thrill Digger\n>>can be yours for only <r<20 Rupees>>.\n[1]Tell me![2-]Nah...
Huh? Another stranger? And you're\nnot one of those red creeps, either.\nI swear this neighborhood's getting\ncrummier every day...
Huh? Oh, nothing, just talking to\nmyself. Hey, I saw this <r<funny-dressed\ncharacter >>go into that hole over there.
It might be the friend you're looking\nfor? You want to know what this\nkook was wearing?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x120CLet's see...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E Yeah, I'm pretty sure the\ngetup was <r<blackish>>. Other than that, I\ndon't remember much.
I'm pretty sure the getup was blackish.\nBesides that, I don't remember much.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xD11Huh? Who're you supposed to be?\nNever seen you around here before...\n\n\nWhoa, hold it right there! \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\xD12Are you a\nfriend of those red creeps?\n[1]No way! [2]Red creeps?

\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00Yeah, monsters carrying big blades?\nThey're crawling all over the place.\nCan't believe you haven't run into any\nof 'em.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xFF07But if you don't know 'em, I guess\nyou're not pals.\n\n\nSo what is it then?

\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00<y<Bomb flowers>>. You're joking, right?\n\x0E\x01\n\x04\x11ÍThose are them growing right over\nthere.
You pick one with (A), and the fuse\nlights. A few seconds later...BOOM!\nYou don't wanna stop and sniff this\nflower. Dangerous plants, believe me.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x80BBut once you learn to use them, they're\na powerful weapon.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x20BThat's what I figured. You can pick\nsome pretty powerful ones in this area.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFF\x0E\x01\n\x04\x11ÍLook! There are some right over there!\nTake as many as you want.
I'm sure you already know this, but\nonce you pick a flower with (A), the\nfuse starts burning.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x809Of course you do! You use the\nWii Remote. <g<Point it up and wave it\nforward >>to <g<throw >>things. <g<Point it down\nand wave it forward >>to<g< roll >>'em.\nI mean, hey, everyone knows that!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1215Don't know any of this stuff, huh?~~~\nNo worries, pal.

I'm stating the obvious here, but you\ncan <g<pick up and put down >><y<bomb flowers\n>>with (A), the same way you do with jars.\n\nWhen you're holding something,\n<g<point up and wave >>the Wii Remote\ndown to throw it.\n\nTo roll it, <g<point down and wave >>the\nWii Remote up.\n\n\nGo on and practice a bit with those\n<y<bomb flowers >>over there.

And I want to\nknow who's dropping by my dirty hovel.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1009\x9FFOh, and just 'cause you're all rested\ndoesn't mean you can <g<roll around\n>>and bust the place up!
Do me a favor, will ya? Try not to go\ncrazy and<g< roll around >>all over the\nplace. Dust bunnies, ya know?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hey, you! Long time no see. Thanks\nfor helping me earlier.\n\n\nSpeaking of helping, did you find that\nfriend you were looking for?\n[1]Sure did![2]Not yet...

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x13\x100DOh, really? You think those red creeps\nmight have...gulp...you know?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x80EWhat? You know she's still alive?\nThen everything's gonna be fine!\nStop with the sad face, will ya?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x800You give up, she's done for. That's why\nya can't ever, ever crawl into your\ntunnel defeated. Ya hear me?
I just know your friend's waiting on\nyou. That's why ya can't ever, ever\ngive up!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xD0CJust curious, but...what do ya think\nthose red guys eat, anyway?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01You're looking pretty chipper, pal.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x8FFYou come back here to do some\ntreasure hunting this time? In that\ncase, I'll let you in on a little secret.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x80B<b<Eldin Volcano >>is riddled with hidden\ncaves. You can find 'em by checking\naround for thin walls with cracks.\n\nYou can find all kinds of things in these\ncaves. It's mostly <y<Rupees>>, but ya never\nknow. \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x80CI got a hunch there's one right\naround here somewhere...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xD10Huh? It was right there all along?\nNice work, greenie.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFYou can find caves aboveground\nand belowground. I bet you can sniff\nout thin walls wherever you go!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x80CI got a hunch there's one around here\nsomewhere...
Around here, you can find little\npockets or caves hidden behind thin,\ncracked walls. Who knows what\nyou might find in those places...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01You're looking pretty chipper, pal.\nYou come back to do some treasure\nhunting?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x800You may already know this, but <b<Eldin\nVolcano >>is riddled with hidden\ncaves.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFYou can find 'em by checking around\nfor thin, cracked walls.\n\n\nYou can find all kinds of things in these\ncaves. It's mostly <y<Rupees>>, sure, but ya\nnever know. \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x8FFIf you get the itch for loot,\nyou should try some cave hunting.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x801Hey, you! I hope you're taking good\ncare of my <y<Bomb Bag>>.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x9FFBy the way, you ever been to the\nheart of <b<Eldin Volcano>>?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x816It's so hot down there it'll burn the\nclothes right off your back. POOF!\nYour average traveler will be dead in\nminutes.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x9FFBut if you survive... Well, rumor has it\nthere are amazing ruins overflowing\nwith piles and mountains of treasure.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x80BCourse, it's nothing for my people\nto just tunnel right in there, ya know?\nYeah... I may have to make the effort\nsometime in the near future.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x80BLong-lost ruins in the heart of a\nvolcano... Heh... Now that's a tale to\nget any <b<treasure hunter>>'s heart\npumping!
Hey, you! Did ya make it to the ruins?\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x13\x100DI decided it wasn't worth the trouble.\nBoy, was my partner steamed!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFHe kept shouting, \x201CAll you had to do\nwas dig your way in! How hard could it\nbe?\" ~~~He's right too. Digging would\nhave made it easy. Heh heh...
Wonder where the next treasure might\nbe... Gotta remember not to forget\nabout the whole digging thing.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x801Hey, you. Hope you're taking good care\nof my <y<Bomb Bag>>.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFI was nice enough to give it to you, so\nbe sure you put it to good use.\nOh, and don't burn a hole in it!
Wonder where my search for riches\nwill lead me next... A <b<treasure hunter's\njourney never ends>>. Heh heh...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x812Hey, you! You've really got those guys'\nattention. And it looks like they're\nspoiling for a fight.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xD00Take one for the rest of us and chase\n'em outta here, will you?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x800Hey! No running away! Take care of\nthese creeps, will ya?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x809You got those creeps all worked up, so\nnow you've got to take care of 'em!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFFFFBut they keep using that <r<horn to call\nin reinforcements>>. They just keep\ncoming and coming!\n\nI bet the horn blower in the<r< blue hat>><pling>\nis the leader.
