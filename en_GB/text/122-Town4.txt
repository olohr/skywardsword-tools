\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Next, a dash of pepper...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Delicious! Another culinary delight\nready to be savored and enjoyed!
Only one thing to do when you're tired:\nget some sleep. \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x19<g<You can sleep anywhere\nthere's a bed>>, you know?\n\nSkyloft is a different place after the\nsun goes down. It's no lie.\n\n\n<g<Find a bed and take a nap>> to sleep until\nnightfall. There's all kinds of curious\nthings to enjoy at night...
Have you explored Skyloft at night?\nIt's a different place under the cover\nof darkness.\n\nFor example, if you go to the gear shop\nowner's house at night, he'll buy your\ntreasures.\n\nNow it's true there are dangers to be\nfound at night, but a student at the\nKnight Academy should have no\ntrouble with that.\nAll you have to do is <g<nap in a bed >>until\nnightfall.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x19 That's it!
I haven't seen the <b<fortune-teller >>much\nthese days...\n\n\nYou know his crystal ball got broken,\nright? I just hope he's not sitting at\nhome kicking himself for not\nforeseeing this.
His place is over on the <r<eastern\nedge of town>>...\n\n\nIt's a bit too quiet around here without\nhim. Why don't you go check on him?\nMake sure he's doing all right.
Would you mind running over and\nchecking in on him?\n\n\nHis house is on the<r< eastern edge >>of\nSkyloft.
With the fortune-teller back on the job,\nthis place feels alive again. It's just\nnot the same without him.
So the fortune-teller's at home with\na case of the blues, eh?\n\n\nI wonder if he'd come back if we found\nhim a new crystal ball...
What?
So you're on your way to becoming\na knight now, right? Congratulations!\n\n\nBut I'm sure there's still plenty you\ndon't know. Don't forget to press (2)\nif you need a pointer or two.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x5CD
Hi there! I hope you're pressing (2)\nwhenever you need help.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x5CD
I've been hearing a weird rumor.\nApparently, after <r<nightfall>>, people\nhave been hearing a woman sobbing\nin the<r< dormitory>>.\nI tell you, it gives even a big guy like\nme the creeps.
What? \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Calling out for toilet paper\nwhile you're stuck in the restroom?\n\n\nYikes, that's rough. I should know--\nI've been there before.
Huh? A hand? Reaching out of the\nstall?\n\n\nThat...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14that's one way of going about\nit, I guess.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hey, Link! Today's the big\nday, isn't it? You know, the Wing\nCeremony thing!\n\nWin this thing, and you'll get bumped\nup to the senior class.
Here in Skyloft, it's being able to ride a\nLoftwing that separates the kids from\nthe adults.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\x404And if your goal is to become a knight,\nwell, good technique is even more\nimportant. All of us learned to fly the\nhard way: lots of practice.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Ever heard of banging your knuckles\nagainst the door? It's called knocking.\nBarging into someone's house is what\nmost people call...rude.\nAnyway, you're lucky I'm home.\nI'm usually over at the bazaar working\nat my stall, but we're closed for the \nWing Ceremony.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x15Most days at work all I can think about\nis how bored I am, but now that I'm\nnot at work, I'm...even more bored!\nMy life is pretty sad...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Is that you, Link?\nWhat are you doing up so late?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x1300I'm hungry! My mom's still cooking,\nbut it's taking forever. When will it\nbe ready?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03Heyyy! Up to some late-night mischief,\neh? Better watch yourself, or a Remlit\nwill take a bite out of your backside!\n\nMost of us don't go out after dark\nwithout a really good reason, y'know?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Heyyy, kid! I hope you're putting ol'\nScrapper to good use.\n\n\nHe's got a bit of a mouth on him, but\nhe's a robot with a good heart. Well,\nif robots had hearts...\n\nJust remember to treat him kindly,\nand everything will work out fine!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00VGood grief! Will you talk to that boy\nof mine for me?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00VAll that lug does is make one filthy\nmess after another. I swear he leaves\na grease spot wherever he sits!\n\nI know he likes tinkering around with\nhis oily doodads, but I'm drowning in\ndirty laundry here!\n\n[1]That lug? [2]Sounds tough.
That's right! My greasy-fingered son\nwho runs the Scrap Shop in the bazaar!
It IS tough! That greasy lug nut is\nfraying my wires!
He's up at unspeakable hours trying to\nrepair that rusty pile of an old robot he\ninherited!\n\nWhat he intends to do with that\nscrap-heap reject is beyond me!
I thought he would settle down a bit\nand maybe even wash his hands now\nthat he's got that robot up and running,\nbut he's still tinkering away!\nI'm telling you, that boy will never get\nthe grease out from beneath his\nfingernails. Ah...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\nPardon me, Link.\nYou haven't seen Kukiel, have you?\n\n\nShe's always running off without a\nword to anyone. I don't know what I'm\ngoing to do with her.\n\nI guess she'll never learn unless she\nruns into trouble one day.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hi, Link. Have you seen\nKukiel anywhere?\n\n\nI swear that child can disappear in the\nblink of an eye! She's quite a magician.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hi, Link! This house\nbelongs to Kukiel. Pssst--by the way,\nthat's ME.\n\nI'm gonna go play with my special\nfriend today! It's going to be so much\nfun!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x11Zzz...let's play....zzz...\nUncle Bats!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, just look at Kukiel\nsleeping. She sure is a cutie.\n\n\nShe makes all the hard work I do\nmeaningful and gives me reason to\nkeep on doing it.\n\nNo idea who or what \x201CUncle Bats\" is.\nSilly girl.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04I wonder where that little mischief-\nmaker Kukiel's gone off to now.\n\n\nHer mom thinks she was kidnapped,\nbut I'm not so sure.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xD00I mean, there's nobody here in Skyloft\nwho would do such a thing, right?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\xD0FI bet she'll show up sooner or later.\n\n\n\nAnyway, keep your eyes peeled, and let\nus know right away if you see her.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01I heard you're the one responsible\nfor finding Kukiel!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x09Thank you so much! Just look at her...\nShe puts her parents through all\nthat worry and heartache, and now\nshe's out like a light.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hey, Link! Have you \ntaken a look here recently?\n\n\nThere's not a Keese to be seen.\nNo other angry monsters either...\n\n\nBeen a while since I could take a quiet\nwalk out in the dark...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EWhat? Are you serious? You found\nKukiel?\n\n\nWhat did I tell you? Nobody here in\nSkyloft would harm a hair on her head!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Oh, good evening. It's awfully late,\nbut is there something I can do for\nyou?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x12I still can't find Kukiel!\n\n\n\nWould you please help me find her?\nJust...hurry!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Hey there, Link.\n\n\n\nYou know what's funny? Folks here call\nthis the <r<Light Tower>>. It's supposedly\nhere to help people find Skyloft and\nprevent them from crashing into us.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xD00But I've never seen any light coming\nout of it. I wonder who built it.\nAnd why...\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\xD00You should climb all the way to the top,\nanyway. There's one amazing view of\nthe goddess from up there.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xD05Me?\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x800No, thank you, I'm good right down\nhere. Me and heights, we don't get\nalong.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xD12Oh, it's you, Link.\nLooks like Kukiel's run off again.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00My wife's in hysterics. She's telling\nfolks our girl's been kidnapped.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\xD03But it's Kukiel we're talking about\nhere!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n You can bet she's just off playing\nsomewhere.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xD00Let me know if you see her, OK?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Hey, Link! Kukiel's come\nhome!\n\n\nI heard you were the one who found\nmy girl!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\xD09Thanks a lot! The missus is grinning\nfrom ear to ear.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Hi, Link!\n\n\n\nThis is the<r< Light Tower>>! You should try\nclimbing to the top. It is sooooo cool\nup there!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2507\x707Such a beautiful day, but we're too busy\nto enjoy it. Some things never change.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2607\x701Isn't that the truth! The only thing my\nlug nut of a son is good for is getting\ngrease on his shirt! All I do is laundry,\nlaundry, laundry. It never ends!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2707\x702I hear you! And I'm terrible at washing\nclothes. I wish I could get someone to\ndo it for me.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2507\x707Did you hear the news? One of the\nstudents in the Wing Ceremony has\nlost his bird. It's gone missing!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2607\x701Oh, really? That's terrible!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2707\x702To tell the truth, I'm not comfortable\naround birds. It's their talons--they\nlook so sharp and painful!
Let me give you some information you\nmight find useful somewhere down\nthe line.\n\nThe Knight Academy you and your\nfriends attend produces some\nfirst-class Loftwing riders.\n\nKeep your nose to the grindstone,\nand you might find yourself soaring\nthrough the skies and protecting the\ngood folk of Skyloft too.\nDon't know if you've met 'em or not,\nbut the rescue knights save anyone\nclumsy enough to fall off of Skyloft.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x700Only the Knight Academy's seniors are\ninvited to join that group. They're the\nbest of the best!\n\nYou might just have what it takes to\njoin them, but don't think it'll be easy.\nNo slacking, you hear!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700Guess I should tell you my grandson's\none of 'em! Heh ~~heh ~~heh.
Heh heh heh. Seems like you're on the\nroad to success, little friend. How 'bout\nI buy us a beverage?\n[1]Thanks! [2-]Nah.
Hmph! No time for an old-timer...\nI see how it is.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x700There's a good lad. Cheers!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700That's the stuff! There we go!
Stop by and chat with me once in a\nwhile, you hear? I may be old, but I'm\nnot boring.
Let me tell you something that may\ncome in handy.\n\n\nWhen you're out on the skies, you might\nsee<r< ring-shaped rocks >>now and again.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x700I've heard there's some kind of \nunknown energy that builds up in the \ncenter of those big rocks.\n\nSo get this: if you fly your Loftwing\nthrough a hole, you'll come blasting\nout like you were shot out of a cannon.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700I hear all the hotshot knights use this\ntrick to cover huge distances in a\nhurry.
Let me share a bit of wisdom with you.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x700The sky is filled with floating islands\nof all shapes and sizes. Skyloft just\nhappens to be the one we call home.\n\nAnd no one knows when they were\ncreated or just how it is they stay\nairborne.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700The only thing I can tell you with any\ncertainty is that we owe all of it--and\nthat includes our life here--to the\ngenerosity of the goddess.
Listen--here's a little information you\nmay find useful.\n\n\nAre you using those <y<Stamina Potions\n>>they're selling over at the bazaar?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x700It's great stuff! Drink some of that,\nand your stamina gauge doesn't empty\nout so darn fast.\n\nAnd it's not just for running, either!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700You can do spin attacks without getting\ntired so easily! I suggest you carry one\naround in case you tangle with\nsomething big and nasty.
You looking to get your grub on?\nThe food here is sooooo good!\n\n\nYou gotta be patient, though. It seems\nlike you wait forever for anything\naround here.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Hi, Link. Are you tired?\nYou look beat.\n\n\nI know how you feel! I'm always up\nfor a quick nap.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\xD00You just make yourself at home.
Mirror, mirror, on the wall...\nWho's the loveliest of them all?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x2200\x02That IS what you were thinking,\nright, Link?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1211\x16Th-~~~thanks for your help!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1408\x913Don't you mention it!\n\n\n\nI guess I should hustle over and say\nhello to your mother too.\n\n\nI'm sure she's just like you, Pipit--\ntrustworthy and dependable.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1209\xC18Whoa! Uhhhh, that's moving a bit too\nfast, don't you think?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1400\x05Of course not! Don't be silly. It's best\nto get these things sorted out right\naway.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1408\x913I hope you'll invite me to your house\nnext time.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x812This is unbelievable... The goddess\nstatue is gone!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xD00Would somebody please explain just\nwhat's going on here in Skyloft?
And my little girl, Kukiel, still hasn't\ncome home. I'm starting to get\nworried.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x800Would you please go and look for\nher, Link?
It may look like my master only tinkers\nwith machines as a hobby, bzzt, but\nthat's not the whole story...vrrrrm...\n\nHe's building an automatic washing\nmachine for his mother, bzzt-CLANG!\n\n\nIsn't that great, vrrrrm?\n\n\n\nHe's not at all like a certain someone\nI know who drags Mistress Fi around\nthe world without a care for her\nsafety or happiness, bzzat!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x05Man, it feels good to just sit here and\nrelax.\n\n\nI like to kick back here and spend time\nthinking about that girl.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\n\xC00Yep, <b<Kina >>is the best thing about the\nold pumpkin bar. She's adorable!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x1104I wonder what they're talking about\nover there. It looks pretty serious.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x1101Hey! Shouldn't you rush off and look\nfor your bird? I think you should.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Hey, mister! Did you know the goddess\nis gone?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x11Do you think she got mad and left\n'cause I never listen to my mom\nand dad?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x30AHEY!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF04Oh... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14I guess it's OK as long as you're\ngoing to just sit.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\x3FFBut listen up! THAT is an expensive\nchair, and if you get it dirty... Well, I\ncan't be held responsible for what\nhappens.
You're too late for breakfast.\nWe stopped serving hours ago.\nYou'll have to wait for lunch!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dZrrrt! This is the entrance to the\nvolcano! \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EI better get there before\nMaster Shortpants!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x70A\xC12Uh... \x0E\x01\x08\x02\xFECDI wonder where she's gone...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Hey, Link! Nice night for\na stroll outside, eh? I forgot how nice\nit feels to be out here at night with no\nmonsters to bother you.
