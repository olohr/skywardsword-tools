I have identified the item that the...\nhighly unusual man on Fun Fun Island\nsays was lost.\n\nWe can call the Scrap Shop robot to\ncome and retrieve it. Would you like me\nto call the robot?\n[1]Yes![2-]No, thanks.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master. If you change your mind\nand decide to retrieve it, please\nexamine it again.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master, I will send word to the robot\nusing telepathic transmission.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dMistress Fi, zrrpt! You called?\n\n\n\nWhoa, zrrft... This place seems\nstrangely familiar, brrzrrt...\n\n\nBzzzt, so you want me to carry this\nthing?
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dI'll be waiting for you in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrt!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I suggest that we head back to\nthe sky and return this party wheel to\nits owner as soon as possible.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dOK, OK, zrrft... You just sit tight\nthere and stay out of my way,\nMaster Shortpants, bzzzt!
I have identified the item that the\nunusual man on Fun Fun Island says\nwas lost.\n\nUnder usual circumstances, we could\ncall the Scrap Shop robot to come and\nretrieve it.\n\nHowever, the robot is currently\ncarrying out some duties at Eldin\nVolcano, so we cannot call him here.\n\nI recommend returning to Eldin\nVolcano and verifying the status\nof the robot.
