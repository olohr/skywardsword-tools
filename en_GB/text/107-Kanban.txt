\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link... Observe.\nThe <r<green pillar>> before you is a <b<column\nof light>>. It marks the point at which\nyou can descend to the surface.
You can confirm your current\nlocation on the map. Please see\nwhere you are in relation to Skyloft.
It appears that you will be able to reach\nthe surface by passing through the\nportal in the clouds at the column's\nbase.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I have an update regarding\nthe stone tablet and the resulting\ncolumn of light it created.\n\nA column of light has appeared to the\nsouthwest of our location, and signs\nindicate that it has created an opening\nin the cloud barrier to the land below.
I must also caution you that descending\nto the surface armed only with a sword\nwould result in a decreased probability\nof survival.\nIf you have not already done so, I\nadvise you to purchase a <r<shield>> and\n<r<potions >>at the bazaar in preparation\nfor your journey.
Another subject to discuss, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Once you are accustomed to the\ncontrols, you are free to modify the\non-screen <r<interface>>.\n\nOn the <b<Gear Screen>>, select <r<Interface\n>>to change the on-screen display to suit\nyour preferences.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, the column of light is visible\nfrom here.
Dive off a ledge and call your Loftwing\nfrom here, where you can see the\ncolumn of light.
It is time for you to set out on your\nsearch for Zelda. You can call your\nLoftwing with (v) after you dive off.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x9CD
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I suggest\nyou imbue that crest with the power of\nyour <r<Skyward Strike>> and then insert\nthe tablet I gave you a moment ago.\nTo gather energy from the heavens\nand charge up a <r<Skyward Strike>>,\n<g<point your sword skyward>>.
I am known as <b<Fi>>... Please step up to\nthe pedestal and draw the sword.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, please\ninsert the <r<stone tablet >>you recently\nacquired into the altar.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link...\n\n\n\nWhen you hit that <r<Goddess Cube >>with\na <r<Skyward Strike>> earlier, I was able\nto detect a resulting energy reaction\nabove the clouds.

The location I have marked on your\nmap indicates the spot where I sensed\nan energy reaction.
I advise you to investigate the area\naround this location.




A seedling planted here would require\nseveral thousand years to mature.\nI would suggest not planting one\nat this location.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster.\n\n\n\nDue to your sword's enhancements, it is\nnow possible to use your <r<dowsing>> ability\nto detect feelings of gratitude.\n\nI have added <r<Gratitude>> <r<Crystals>> to\nyour list of <r<dowsing>> targets.<pling>

However, I sense that you have already\ngathered all of the gratitude possible,\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master. Congratulations.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster.\n\n\n\nAnalysis indicates Loftwings cannot\nfly at night. Please return to your bed\nand rest, then depart during the day.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster.\n\n\n\nI have determined that there is a <r<Trial\nGate>> somewhere among these floating\nislands that can be opened by the\nSong of the Hero.\nI suggest you use your <r<dowsing >>ability\nto locate it.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Congratulations, Master.\n\n\n\nYou have passed all of the trials.
The <r<\x0E\x02\x01\x02´>> you just obtained is\nactually one of a pair, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\n\nAnother similar object with a mark\njust like the one you hold exists\nsomewhere on this island.\n\nCombining the two should open the\nway to the <y+<Triforce>>.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\n\x04\xFFFFÍI suggest that you search for that\nmatching stone.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I have\nmemories of this island.\n\n\nIt is known as the <b<Isle of Songs>>.\nSigns indicate that it was left here\nfor you by the goddess, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.\n\nHowever, I am unable to determine a\nmeans of entering the structure ahead.\nI suggest you investigate the area.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I have confirmed the location\nof a second opening in the cloud\nbarrier. It is located in the skies to\nthe northeast.\nThis opening will allow you to access a\nnew area on the surface. I suggest\nyou fly there as soon as you complete\nnecessary preparations.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BI've confirmed the location of a third\nopening in the cloud barrier in the\nsky to the southwest.\n\nIt will allow you to reach a new area on\nthe surface. I suggest going there as\nsoon as you are suitably prepared.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link...\n\n\n\nIt will be necessary for you to learn\nhow to execute the Spiral Charge\nmaneuver in order to rid Levias of\nhis blight.\nOwlan is currently waiting <r<near the\nbird statue>> in the northeastern part\nof Skyloft. I suggest you go there\nto speak with him.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\n\x04\x0DÍThis treasure-chest-like object is a\nrelic of ancient times, left by the\ngoddess for her chosen hero.
However, I lack any information on\nhow it can be opened at this time.
It would appear that each chest\nresponds to the energy released when a\nspecific <r<Goddess Cube>> is launched\nskyward, releasing its lock mechanism.\nSearch for Goddess Cubes in the lands\nbelow and send them into the air.\nIt is the only way to open these chests.
