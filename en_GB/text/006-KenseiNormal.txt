\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Something here is reacting to our\nperformance of Farore's Courage.\nI have confirmed the appearance of\na strange mark on the ground.\nI calculate a 90% possibility that this\nmark is a Trial Gate, as mentioned\nby the goddess statue we heard\nfrom on the Isle of Songs.\nThrust your sword into the center\nof the mark on the ground before you.
Thrust your sword into the center of\nthe mark and open the way to a new\nSilent Realm.
Thrust your sword into the center of\nthe mark and open the way to the final\nSilent Realm.






\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, the melody you just acquired is\none part of the <b<Song of the Hero>>.\n\n\nI recommend you seek out the other\ntwo dragons in their respective areas\nto learn the other two parts of the\nsong.
Well done, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master. You have acquired\nthe second part of the Song of the\nHero. The final part can be found\nsomewhere within <b<Faron Woods>>.

Well done, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master. You've successfully\ncollected three parts of the Song of the\nHero.\n\nI recommend you return to the sky\nand meet with the great sky spirit,\n<b<Levias>>, to complete the song.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I have information for you.\nYou have obtained a map of this area.\nYou can view it by pressing \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x3CD.\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x3CD\n\nThe position of doors and their locks,~~~\nas well as the position and status of\ntreasure chests,~~~ can be confirmed on\nthe map with marks such as \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x19CD.\nHowever, be aware that you will be\n<r<unable to use beacons>> here due to\nthe indoor nature of this environment.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link.\nI have detected the aura of a Trial Gate\nnearby.\n\nIf you can pinpoint the origin of this\naura using dowsing, I conjecture the\nsong you learned at the Isle of Songs,\nFarore's Courage, will reveal the gate.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster. The volcanic activity\nthat impeded your return to the sky\nearlier has ceased.\n\nIt is now possible to return to the sky\nagain.

After winning the race in the Wing\nCeremony, you went on a flight with\n<b<Zelda>> where you encountered a storm\nthat caused Zelda to fall to the surface.\nShortly thereafter, you entered an\nold chamber and claimed the\nGoddess Blade in which I, <b<Fi>>, reside.\n\nYou then used the power of an ancient\n<y<tablet >>to open a <r<column of light\n>>leading to the land below.
After winning the race in the Wing\nCeremony, you took to the sky with\n<b<Zelda>> where you encountered a storm\nthat caused Zelda to fall to the surface.\nDown below the clouds, you met with\na mysterious old woman who spoke of\na great destiny that involves both you\nand Zelda.
To begin your search for <b<Zelda>>, you\ndescended to the surface, where you\nmet a mysterious old woman who spoke\nof the destiny invoking you and Zelda.\nShortly thereafter you made your way\nto <b<Faron Woods>>, and learned from the\n<b<Kikwis>> that Zelda entered a temple\nin the area.
In order to find <b<Zelda>>, you descended\nto the surface and explored <b<Skyview\nTemple >>deep within <b<Faron Woods>>.\n\nAt the temple, you discovered a statue\nof the goddess whose song indicates\nthat Zelda has now headed to\n<b<Eldin Province>>.
In your search for <b<Zelda>>, who fell\nbeneath the clouds to the land below,\nyou have made your way to\n<b<Eldin Volcano>>.\nJudging by conversations of the <b<Mogma>>\nwe overheard, I conjecture that Zelda\nis inside the <b<Earth Temple>>.
We have learned that <b<Zelda>>, who fell\nto the surface and is still missing, is\ntraveling with an <r<unknown person >>for\nreasons we do not fully understand.\nJudging by the song from the goddess\nstatue that we heard, you now know\nthat Zelda headed to <b<Lanayru\nProvince>>.
We have learned that <b<Zelda>>, who fell\nto the surface and is still missing, is\ntraveling with an <r<unknown person >>for\nreasons we do not fully understand.\nI infer these two entered the <b<Temple of\nTime>> in <b<Lanayru Desert>>, but we are\nunable to enter the temple via usual\nmeans as the gate has been destroyed.
For reasons we do not fully understand,\n<b<Zelda>> has been traveling all across the\nland.\n\nYou were successful in meeting her\nat the <b<Temple of Time>>, but our\ndiscourse was cut short by <b<Ghirahim>>,\nwho attempted to attack Zelda.\nDuring Ghirahim's attack, Zelda\nentrusted you with her <r<harp>> and then\nran from the area through a <r<strange\ngate>>. 
In order to accomplish her own\nmission, Zelda entrusted her harp to\nyou and fled through a Gate of Time.\n\nA second Gate of Time exists, but in\norder to activate it you will need to\n<r<enhance your sword>>.
<b<Zelda>> passed through a Gate of Time \nin order to accomplish her mission.\nYou will need to <r<enhance your sword>>\nto open the gate and reach her.\nTo meet this goal, you learned a song\nknown as <r<Farore's Courage>> on the <b<Isle\nof Songs>>.

After passing through the Gate of\nTime, you have at last reunited with\n<b<Zelda>>.\n\nIt is there that Zelda revealed that\nyour destiny is to vanquish Demise.\n\n\nYou also learned that the key to finding\nthe one power vital to defeating\n<b<Demise>>, the <y+<Triforce>>, is hidden\nsomewhere within <b<Skyloft>>.
