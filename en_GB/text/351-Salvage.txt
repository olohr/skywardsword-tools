I have located a substance that closely\nresembles the material used in the\nfortune-teller's crystal ball... It should\nmake a suitable replacement.\nShall I call the robot to collect it?\n[1]Yes.[2-]Not now.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master. If you change your mind\nand decide to retrieve it, please\nexamine it again.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master, I will send word to the robot\nusing telepathic transmission.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dMistress Fi! I'm heeeeereeeee, zrrpt!\n\n\n\nOh. You want me to carry this old\nthing, bzzt?
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dI'll be waiting for you in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrt!!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I suggest we also return to\nthe sky and collect the crystal ball as\nsoon as possible.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dHey, Master Shortpants! How come\nyou always get the easy jobs, zrrpt?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x09So we meet again, eh? I gotta thank ya\nfor your help last time!\n\n\nSee, I've been searchin' for new\ntreasure spots, but I can't find a\nsingle bauble or bit of treasure.\n\nMaybe I'm just gettin' woozy from\nworking so long in this heat.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x05Sometimes I wish I could find a job that\nreally played to my strengths, yeah...\nsomethin' in a cool climate. Then I'd\nbe set!\n[1]I know a place![2]Keep dreaming.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04So ya know a place with work that I'd\nbe good at?\n\n\nAnd it's in the sky?!\n...\n...\nI LOVE THE SKY!\nWhere do I sign up?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n I'm tellin' ya,\nI'm in! Let's do this thing!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x08Right...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n Well, yeah, I guess I could try\nto stick it out for a little while longer...
This individual's capabilities match\nperfectly to the types of duties\nexpected of an employee at the Lumpy\nPumpkin.\nDo you want to call the robot and\ntransport this individual?\n[1]Yes.[2-]No.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Hey, what gives?! You said you'd take\nme to the sky, but then you backed out\nof our deal! Now I'm back here.\n\nIf you're going to make a promise\nlike that, you better follow through!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I suggest that we also return\nto the sky and accompany the Mogma\nto his destination quickly.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dYou don't have to tell me twice, zrrbt!
