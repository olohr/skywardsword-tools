\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link...
You stand within <b<Din's Silent Realm>>,\nthe third trial. It will test the limits of\nyour <r<power>>.\n\nTo locate the last flame that will\nenhance your sword, you must first\ncomplete this final challenge and\nachieve spiritual growth once again.
When your vessel is full, your spirit\nwill grow and you will be entrusted\nwith a <r<new power >>by the goddess.\n\nDo you have any questions?\n[1]Yes![2-]No.
Which topic do you wish to review?\n\n\n[1]The \x0E\x02\x01\x02\x11?[2]Guardians?[3]Waking Water?[4-]Never mind.
Do you have any further questions?\n\n[1]The \x0E\x02\x01\x02\x11?[2]Guardians?[3]Waking Water?[4-]Never mind.
Understood, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, I await your return in the\noutside world.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master.\n\n\n\nTo fill the <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02\x11>>, you\nneed to locate and collect the\n<y<<y<Tears of Din<y< >>scattered\nacross this Silent Realm.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, do you see the glowing\nobject ahead of you?
That is a <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02,>>.\nYou will need to collect <r<15 >>of them.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master.
If you take even a single step outside\nthe protective circle you stand in, the\n<r<Guardians >>of this realm will wake up\nand pursue you, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master.
If a <r<Guardian >>manages to land even a\nsingle hit on you, your spirit will\nshatter and you will fail the trial.
You must collect the <y<tears>> scattered\nthroughout this area and fill the\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02\x11 >>without being hit by\nan attack.
The unusual liquid substance that\ncovers that area is known as <r<Waking\nWater>>, and it has certain unique\nproperties.\nIf you make contact with Waking\nWater, the <r<Guardians will be\nimmediately alerted to your presence>>.\n\nPools of Waking Water are located all\nthroughout the area. I suggest you\nwatch where you step...

When your <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02\x11>> is filled with\n15 <r<tears>>, your spirit will grow and you\nwill be blessed by the goddess with a\nnew power.\n\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, I will await your return in the\noutside world.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master Link, I can\nunfortunately confirm that you\nhave failed to pass the trial.
Collect all the <y<tears>> within the Silent\nRealm. I shall await your return here.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master, so long as you have the will and\ndetermination, you can retry a trial\nas many times as you like.\n\nA good strategy is <r<to find, but then\ndeliberately not pick up>>, the most\neasily accessible <y<<y<tears<y< >>until you are\ndiscovered and really need one.\nCollect the 15 <y<tears>> and complete the\ntrial. I will await your return in the\noutside world.
The locations of <y<tears>> you have\ngathered during your trial are\n<r<marked on the map>>.\n\nYou will have an easier time\ncompleting your task if you\nfirst set out to discover the\nlocations of all 15 tears.
<r<Two types of Watchers >>patrol the\nrealm, looking for intruders. I highly\nsuggest you take caution.\n\nSo long as you do not step into their\nlight, you will remain undetected\nby <r<flying Sky Watchers>>.\n\nHowever, the <r<Earth Watchers>>, who\n<r<hover near the ground>>, will give chase\nif you come too close to them, so <r<stay\nalert >>and maintain a safe distance.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, the chances of your not being\nthe chosen one are increasing...\n\n\nRepeated attempts at this trial have\nscattered your concentration and made\nyour performance erratic. I suggest\nyou rest awhile before trying again.
I suggest using smart tactics to your\nadvantage. Try <r<leaving easy-to-collect\ntears >>for when you are being pursued.
The locations of <y<tears >>that you have\npreviously collected will be <r<marked\non the map>>, so make good use of that.\n\nConfirm the locations of all 15 tears\nfirst to increase your chances of\nsuccessfully completing the trial.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, in addition to the <r<Guardians>>\nwho will attack you, there are also two\ntypes of <r<Watchers >>that search for\nintruders <r<on the ground and in the sky>>.\nThe two types of overseers exhibit\ndramatically different behavior, so be\nsure you understand how to avoid\ndetection by both.
We're here, Link!\nShow me what you've got!
