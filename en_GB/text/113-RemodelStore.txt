\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x800OK. One shield in need of patching up.\nThat'll be <r<10 rupees>>.\n[1]OK![2-]No, thanks.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x800Hey, kid! You want me to fix any of\nyour other shields?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x800Hey, kid! Looks like you're out of\nshields that need repairing.\nSee you later!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! It looks like you're a bit short\non materials. You don't have enough\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02¡>>.\n\nMy grandpa's notes say you can find\nthe stuff in some of the Deku Hornet\nhives found in heavily wooded areas.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700So, is there anything else you want to\nupgrade?

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! You're a little short on\nmaterials. You don't have enough\n<y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02¤s>>.\n\nMy grandpa's notes say you can get\nthese from monsters that look like\nlizards.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CLooks like you're coming up short on\nmaterials, kid. Yep, you don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02¥>>.\n\nMy grandpa's notes say you can find\nthat stuff buried within fiery\nmountains.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02«s>>.\n\nGrandpa's notes say you can get 'em\nfrom monsters that use them to call\ntheir buddies, but you'd need to pull\n'em out of their hands using something.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CLooks like you're coming up short on\nmaterials, kid. Yep, you don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02¬s>>.\n\nAccording to my grandpa's notes,\nyou can sometimes get these from\nmonsters that carry clubs...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02­s>>.\n\nAccording to my grandpa's notes, you\ncan get 'em by slaying monsters who\nhave the power to curse you...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02®s>>.\n\nMy grandpa's notes say you can get\nthese feathers from the rare little\nblue birds living in wooded areas.\nYou'll need a Bug Net, though!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02¯s>>.\n\n<y<\x0E\x03\x01\x00\x0E\x02\x01\x02¯s>> are \x0E\x02\x01\x02¬s\nthat shine bright like gold. Seems like\nthey are crazy rare!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHey, kid! Looks like you're a bit\nshort on materials. You don't have\nenough <y<\x0E\x02\x01\x02°s>>.\n\nThey're very rare and extremely\nvaluable, or at least that's what it says\nhere in my grandpa's notes.

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03Hey, kid! What's up? You look like you\nneed to get something off your chest...\n\n\nI think I know what it is. You've got a\nfavor to ask me, right?\n[1]Yes.[2-]Not really.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x10\x1008...Huh? \x0E\x01\x04\x02(It's about this old robot my\ngrandpa used to tinker around with?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\xE00...You probably just came here to make\nfun of the crazy junk guy for believing\nin his grandpa's stupid stories, right?\n\nWell, get in line... I've heard it before.\x0E\x01\x04\x02(\nWait... That's not why you're here?\nYou say you need to pick up something\nfrom below the clouds with this robot?\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700Do you know what that means?!\nThat means...you believe in my\ngrandpa's stories too, don't you?!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x900Well, I'm happy to hear that someone\nelse believes me, but I don't think I can\nhelp you. You see, my grandpa's old\nrobot... What's it called again...
Oh, hey, that's right... I remember!\nHis name is <b<Scrapper>>. He may not be\nmuch to look at these days...\n\nBut he was an amazing robot once!\nWhen you called him, he would go\nanywhere and haul anything!\n\nSadly, as you can see now\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Íhe's just\nanother busted ol' hunk of junk...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\xE00But old Gramps did tell me this:\nyou can get him working again with the\nextract from an <y<Ancient Flower>>.\nIt's like oil to this guy.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\xE00But I've never even heard of, much less\nseen, any such thing!\n[1]Take mine![2-]Me neither.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x717WHAT?! You have one?! Are you\nkiddin' me?! That's amazing!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x916Yeah, who has, right?\nBut if I just had one <y<Ancient Flower>>...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\xE0CHold it\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFDCD... Why would you say you have\none when you really don't?! That's a\ndirty trick, kid.


\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01If you want me to get <b<Scrapper>> here\nworking again, I need one <y<Ancient\nFlower>>. But I dunno where they are.\n[1]I have one![2-]Me, neither.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x18So this is an <y<Ancient Flower>>?!\nI can feel some slick, oily stuff coming\nout of its stem! Great, with this we can\nfix <b<Scrapper>>!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700...Wait right here! I'll have him up and\nrunning in no time!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x110AWHOA! It talked! Can you believe\nthat? I guess I really did fix him!\n\n\nThis kid gave me the materials I\nneeded to fix you. Go on!\nSay thank you!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x952Heyyyy now! Watch it! That's no way\nto talk to someone who just saved\nyour life!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700...Anyway, this kid wants you to haul\nsome stuff around, and you're going\nto help him!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x1104So...take good care of <b<Scrapper>>\nfor me, will you? By the way, he can\nsense people's thought waves or\nsomething...\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\x700That means wherever you are, if you\nneed him, he'll be there in a jiffy!\n\n\nHe's got kind of a mean little mouth on\nhim, but if he's in a good mood, he'll\nwork hard for you!\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EAnyway, enough of my yappin'!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700So how 'bout another upgrade?\nI'll repair your shield too!\n[1]Upgrade.[2]Repair shield.[3-]No, thanks.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00e\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0FPhew\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFCCD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í There you go!\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x1E\x00

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x700So how do you plan to recover all the\nstuff that fell beneath the clouds?\n\n\nYou know, you could always ask the\n<r<fortune-teller >>over there...\n\n\nI know he's kind of goofy looking,\nbut when it comes to finding things,\nhe's always right on the money.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x161A\x200Thank you, BZZRT! I've got a full tank\nof energy, and I'm ready to carry\nanything, zzzzt!
\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160C\x900Huh...?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E Who is this green-clad\nindividual of small stature?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160B\x900...Hmmm. Are you sure it was him,\ngrrzt?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160C\x900...Well then, I extend my reluctant\nthanks to you in a gesture of obligatory\ngratitude, vrrrrrrt-CHONK.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160B\x900Hmmph. This individual may have\nrestored my operations, but I am not\ninclined to offer assistance, zrrt.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160C\x900Serving children is very low in my task\npriority, dzzt!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x161A\x200Who are you?!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160E\x200ZRRPT-FOOOSH!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160E\x200Your name is...Fi? Dzzt! Should I call\nyou Mistress Fi? Are you looking for\nsomething, Mistress Fi?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160C\x200I... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14I understand, vrrt!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160E\x200At your request, I will carry anything,\nregardless of weight or destination...\nwhizzt!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160C\x200Master Shortpants! I offer\nassistance! I can now detect Mistress\nFi's thought waves, vrrt!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x160E\x200Should you need me, ask Mistress Fi to\ncall me, and I will arrive with haste,\nbzzat!
