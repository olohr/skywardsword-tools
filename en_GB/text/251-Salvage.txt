I can verify with only 40% accuracy\nthat this person is a plant. However,\n<b<Owlan>>'s field of study includes\ncataloging unidentified plant species.\nWe can take this creature to Skyloft\nusing the robot. Would you like to call\nthe robot?\n[1]Please![2-]No, thanks.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master. Simply inspect\nthe specimen again if you change your\nmind and wish to take it to Skyloft.
Yes, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master. I will signal the robot\nwith a telepathic transmission.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dMistress Fi! I hope you weren't\nwaiting long, bzzzzat! So you want me\nto carry this, zrrbt?
I'll be waiting for you up in the sky,\nso don't take too long, vrrrt!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, I suggest we also return to\nthe sky and carry the Kikwi to its\ndestination quickly.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dMove it! Move it! Zrrppt! Forcing me to\ntell you this every time reduces my\noverall efficiency, brrzt!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Oh, hello again, kweek! I've been\nhiding out so long my shoulders are\nstiff.\n[1]What shoulders?[2]Poor thing.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x14How rude! I do have shoulders,\nkweek--they're just not very\npronounced!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x11All I was trying to say is that constantly\nhiding from danger is a stressful way to\nlive, koo-keek!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x11That's right, kwee! Sitting in one spot\nall the time, never knowing when\ndanger is going to come along...kook.\nYou can't know what that's like!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x13I bet there are still tons of horrible\nmonsters out there waiting to scratch\nme and do mean things, koo-weep!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x04We Kikwis have to spend our entire\nlives hiding like this just to survive,\nkwee-koo!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x13Everyone seems happy that peace\nhas returned to the forest... But I don't\nbelieve it for a second, koo-kakoo!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x04There's no way I'm going to give up\nand come out of hiding. Not ever,\nkee-woop!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x05But sometimes I wonder, keep-eep...\nIsn't there somewhere peaceful I can\nlive without fear, without having to\nhide?\n[1]There is![2]I can help.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x06\x07Oh! That's fantastic news, koo-karoo!\nI want you to take me there as soon as\nyou can!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x14You've got some nerve, ko-ko-ko!\nHow dare you promise to take me to\nthe skies, kee-roo, and then suddenly\nchange your mind!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x13I was so sad thinking I would never get\nto settle down somewhere safe,\nkee-reep!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x04So! Take me with you this time, ka-koo!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Kee-karoo! Don't let me down!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x07\x03Take me to a peaceful place where\nI can live in comfort without having\nto hide, kee-roo!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01I'm counting on you, keek-eep!
