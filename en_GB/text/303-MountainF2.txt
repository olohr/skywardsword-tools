\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, the robot is waiting at the\nvolcano. I suggest you return there.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dWhere have you been, zzzrbt! Get me\nto the top of the volcano! Now, brrzzt!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dDon't leave me! Press \x0E\x02\x04\x02\x3CD to open your\n<r<map >>to find me, zzrrt!\x0E\x01\x11\x02\x3CD

If there's anything else I can do to be\nof assistance, zzzzrp, just call me!\nAnytime, zzzrbtzz!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dWhat's going on, brzzt? I almost blew\na rotor trying to slow myself during\nthat descent, zrbt... Anyway, this is\nwhere you wanted the water, right?\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nWHAT?! THE SUMMIT? ~~~Why didn't\nyou say so from the start, bzzrt?\nI don't want to carry this thing back\nto the sky. IT'S HEAVY, BRZZZT!\nBzzzrt...zrrbt...tzzptrr.~~~
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dThis place is, zrrrt, swarming with\nmonsters. Vrrrrrm...
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dI bust up enemies like a junk-yard\nwrecker, zzizat! Too bad I've got\nmy mitts full with this basin, bzzz...
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dHey, Master Shortpants! Since we\ncame all this way, let's play a little\ngame called \x201Cprotect the robot,\" bzzrt!\n\nHere's how it works--I'll follow you up\nthe volcano, zzzrt, and you make sure\nnothing touches me. Got it? Good!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00dYour job is simple, zzrrt! You make\nsure none of these monsters lays a\nclaw on me. NOT...ONE...CLAW!

\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B09Oh, hey! We meet again. How have you\nbeen, bud?\n\n\nI rumbled over here 'cause I heard\nsomeone had spotted <y<Goddess Cubes\n>>in the area.\n\nYou may have already found some,\nbut I got a feeling there are some\nothers hidden away around here.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x17FFYou might think about searching for\nthem yourself when you get the time.
I have got a hunch there are still \n<y<Goddess Cubes >>on this mountain. \nYou should see if you can find them.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B09Oh, hey! We meet again. How have you\nbeen, bud?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\xBFFI rumbled over here 'cause I heard\nsomeone had spotted some<y< Goddess\nCubes >>in the area.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\xB00I have got a hunch they may be down in\nthat direction, but...this flaming\nwall of fire is blocking the way!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x1B09Hey! Are you here looking for\n<y<Goddess Cubes>> too? Nice work getting \npast that hot spot back there, bud.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00The heat back there did not bother\nme a bit, but these flames right\nhere are another matter.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x17FFI wish there was something we could do\nto put out these flames...
\x201CQuench my thirst\"? Hmm... That\nreminds me. If you head back out of\nhere and turn right, you will end up\noutside.\nI found a <r<spring >>there. <pling>Let me tell you,\nbud, that water was dee-licious!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1705No idea how you would bring it in here,\nthough. I doubt those weird-looking\nfrog beasts would carry it for you.\n~~~Got any ideas?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1700Well, I know if you head out of here\nand hang a right, you will find this\nnice, refreshing <r<spring>>, but...\n\nYeah, I am not sure what you should\ndo, to be honest.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x17\x1908Hey, the flames are out! Now we can\nget through here.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1E56More flames... This is starting to burn\nme up...
Hate to ask you this, bud, but could\nyou do the fire-extinguisher routine\nagain?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x17\x1908Hey! Nice work, bud. Now we are \ngetting somewhere!
Do you see this, bud? Talk about\nintriguing! We are definitely off the\nmap here.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x17\x1908This does not feel like<y< Goddess Cube\n>>stuff to me! I bet there is something\n<r<super important >>hidden around here!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1EFFAll I can say is that is a big frog with\na big thirst. I do not think the amount\nof water one of your little <y<bottles >>can\nhold is going to cut it this time.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x07Hmmm...~~~\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1700 You will have to have a<r< big\ncontainer >>to hold the water needed\nfor this job. <pling>Got anything like that?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1EFFAnd speaking of which, where are you\ngoing to get all the<r< water>>? I gotta\nsay, I am pretty much stumped.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1707How are we supposed to give this fellow\nenough <r<water>>? Whatever it is, it is\ngoing to have to be one<r< big container>>...\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1EFFYou have been adventuring all over the\nplace, right? You got any ideas?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1707Lots of<r< water >>and <r<something to carry it\naround in>>... Any bright ideas on where\nto find those things, bud?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x17\x1908You are something else, bud! There is\nnothing you cannot do!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xBFFYou go ahead on in! You have earned\nthe right to blaze this trail.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x18\x1702Well, how was it? What did you find?\n[1]Traps![2]Monsters!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1E56Is that so? Hmm... Guess I will leave\nthe exploring past here to you, bud.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xBFFBy the way, I have got a hunch there is\na <y<Goddess Cube >>somewhere nearby.\n\n\nAnd my hunches are usually spot on,\nso you should take a good look around.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x16\x1E56Is that so? Hmm... Guess I will leave\nthe exploring past here to you, bud.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x08\xBFFI am going to head out to another\nlocation and continue my research.\nGive me a holler if you see me again.
I am off to continue my research, bud.\nI am sure I will bump into you again!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x801Well, look who we have here! You still\nlooking for your friend?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFOf course, I'm on the hunt for\ntreasure. Heard there were some\nfancy ruins out in this direction...\nSo here I am!\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xDFFBelieve it or not, I haven't found a\nthing. Got any information for me?\n[1]Want to know?[2]I'm not telling!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x900You know something? Spill it!\nWe're friends, right?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x120ADon't get all tight-lipped on me now!\nWe're friends, right? Out with it!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x80EWhat? There's some fire blocking your\npath? Why don'tcha just pour some\nwater on it and move on?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x800Ya need how much water? Whoa...\nI get it. \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14So the water we got here's not\nenough, right?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFYou know, I hear the little water we\ngot here is fed by some far-off water\nsource called <r<Lake Floria<pling>>>.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x8FFSo a buddy of mine went huntin' for\ntreasure in <b<Faron Woods>>, and he told\nme he used the waterways there to find\nhis way back home.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFHe tells me Lake Floria was just about\nthe biggest lake you could imagine. Bet\nif you checked it out, there'd be enough\nwater there to solve your dilemma.
Too bad you came all this way only to\nget stopped dead in your tracks.\nIt's just not your lucky day, bud.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\xDFFUh...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14I get the feeling I'm forgetting\nsomething important...\n\n\nI think it's something my buddy told\nme once, but... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Nope, I can't remember.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x8FFOh well, back to the water. If you need\nlots of the wet stuff, you should head\nover to <r<Lake Floria>>. I think you'll find\nwhat you need.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\xC07Oh, you again! It's been a looong time,\nbut I remember that face.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\x506Heh heh heh. How're those gloves I\ninvented treatin' ya? Are they up to\nyour satisfaction?\n\nHow've I been? Awful nice of ya to ask.\nLemme see...\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\x405I've been searchin' high and low for\nnew treasure, but I've come up empty\npawed.\n\nI gotta say, I'm tired of diggin' after\nmy fortune in this blast furnace.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x908I'm startin' to think it's time I gave\nup this life of treasure hunting and\nsettle down to enjoy my twilight years.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\x405If I'm going to retire, I want to live in\na place up high with a glorious view.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\xDFFI've lived most of my life underground,\nit's true, but I still gaze up at that sky.\nIt's so...big and blue and fluffy.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x906If I had my way, I'd like to come back\nin my next life as a bird and spend my\ntime soaring the wild blue yonder.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2201Whoa there! It's my old pal! How ya\nbeen, old pal?\n\n\nMe? Ah, my claws are sharp and my\nnose is tuned in to treasure! Yep, I'd\nsay I'm great.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02One thing's got me worried, though.\nSee, our elder, <b<Guld>>, has been actin'\nkinda odd since going to those ruins.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x230AWould ya go and see<b< Guld>>? He's over\nthataway somewhere, and I know he'd\nbe happy to see your mug.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x50A<b<Guld>>'s wanderin' around over there\nsomewhere. Go see him! Chat with him\na bit, ya know?\n\nIt might cheer him up to see a familiar\nface.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2001Hey, pal, did ya go and visit the elder?\nHow's he doin'?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2011What? Twilight years?\n\n\n\nUh...\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00ÿwhat are ya talkin' about?\nIs \x201Ctwilight years\" some sort of\ncode name for a big treasure?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x1E15I gotta tell ya, I've never heard of such\na thing.\n\n\nBut if that's what the elder wants help\nwith, go on and help him out, will ya?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2201Whoa! It's my old pal! How've you\nbeen?\n\n\nMe? Ah, my claws are sharp, and my\nnose is tuned in to treasure! I'm great!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02One thing's got me worried, though.\nThe tribal elder's been acting odd since\ngoing to those ruins. He's just not\nhimself.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x22FFYou talked to him earlier, right?\nHow was he doing?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2011What? Twilight years?\n\n\n\nUh...\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00ÿwhat are you talking about?\nIs \x201Ctwilight years\" some sort of code\nname for treasure?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x1E15I gotta tell you, I've never heard of\nsuch a thing. And I know a thing or\ntwo about treasure.\n\nBut if that's what the elder wants, help\nhim out, will ya?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x15Twilight years, eh? Well, if that's\nwhat the elder wants, help an old\nMogma out, will ya?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1C\x180FWh-wha-what? The elder got...\nlaunched up somewhere?\nWhere'd he go, then?\n[1]Up in the sky![2]Beyond...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2011The sky? Up in the big, blue stuff, eh?\n\n\n\nOh... \x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x407Well, \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14he always was talkin' about\nhow much he loved the sky.\n\n\nI bet he's up there now digging around\nin the clouds for treasure.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2011Beyond?\n\n\n\nUh...\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2207beyond? \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14Whaddya mean\n\x201Cbeyond\"? Are ya telling me he's\n\x201Cgone\" gone?\n\nI mean, we all gotta go sometime, \nbut, wow...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x30DElder...I'm gonna do ya proud--just\nwait and see. I hope ya watch over\nme from wherever it is you are now!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x2011What do you mean, the elder's back?\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2207Are you saying he can travel between\nhere and the sky? That is one amazing\nguy, I tell you.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2207Traveling back and forth between here\nand the sky. The elder is soooo cool!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\x200FHey, it's you! That guy from before...~~~\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2209Heh heh heh... Yeah, that was\npretty embarrassing.\n\n\nWe're all good now, though, because\nmy pal found out about it.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x1EFFTruth is he got captured once too.\nGuess that makes us even. Nothin' for\neither of us to worry about.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1A\xA12Yeah, anyway, you seen <b<Plats>> around\nanywhere?\n[1]He was over there.[2]Nope.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\xA12Oh, really? We're all cool, then.\n\n\n\nI just hadn't seen his ugly mug in a\nwhile and, well, you know...\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x160FI thought maybe he'd gone and gotten\nhimself all tied up again.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x16FFLet me tell ya, that guy's like a\ntrouble magnet!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2207That dirt-brain... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14I bet he's off on some\nsolo treasure-hunting dig.\n\n\nHe knows he's not supposed to be out\nby himself. This place is dangerous!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x09What am I supposed to do, huh?\nI guess that's what you get when you're\n<b<treasure hunters>>. Bunch of guys who\ndon't know when to quit.\nIf you happen to run into <b<Plats>>, give\nhim my best, will you?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x1B\x2215The deal with <b<Plats >>is he only shows\nsome backbone when he's off\nhunting treasure.
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x1008Hey, pal! You're still alive!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x110BAnd by the looks of it, ya got all your\nloot back too. I knew you had it in ya.\n\n\nSo, uh...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14did ya find any treasure?\n[1]Tons![2]Not a thing...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x505Seriously? I'm soooo jealous!\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x1F0ABut the world's a big place, ya know?\nAnd I'm sure there's more treasure\nout there for the swiping.\n\nYeah, I'm not sitting on my tail waiting\nfor it to fall into my lap! You know\nwho's going to find all the loot next\ntime? Me! This guy! That's who!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0E\x40AWhaaat? Ya didn't find much of\nanything? Aw, that's too bad, pal.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0F\x508Don't get all sad and weepy on me,\nthough. The world's a big place and\nit's filled with treasure!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0D\x509All right, then. Where's the next place\nto hunt for riches, eh?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Yo, pal. This your idea of a break\nroom? Battling all them monsters\ngot ya a little run down, huh?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x900If those creeps with the <r<big shields>>\nare as tough as they are ugly, they\nmust be a real pain in the neck.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x15\x80BSee, I got some<r< secret information>> that\nI'm sure will make your life easier.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF09Of course, nothing comes for free in\nthis day and age. You're gonna have\nto part with some R-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nU-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nP-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nE-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nE-\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nS.\nThat spells Rupees, by the way.\nIt's all yours for <r<30 Rupees>>.\nWhaddya say?\n[1]Tell me! [2-]Nah.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1215What're you being so stingy for?\nIt's only <r<30 Rupees>>. \n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00All right, whatever. Come see me if you\nchange your mind.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x14\x1215What's the deal, pal? You don't have\nenough Rupees, so you're getting a\nload of nothing from me.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00Find yourself <r<30 Rupees>>, then come\nand see me.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x809Thank you very much, pal! Listen up!\nThis is for your ears only. Don't go\nsquawking about it with every mug\nyou meet.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04ÿ\xFF00Here's the deal... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14The shields those\nlugs are carrying around? You can cut\nthem with your sword!

Quench my thirst to\nclear your path.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster, I have information for you.\nWith the enhanced capabilities of your\nsword, you are now able to use your\n<r<dowsing >>ability to find <y<Goddess Cubes>>. \nI have taken the liberty of registering\n<y<Goddess Cubes >>as <r<dowsing >>targets.\n<pling>Please use this ability as you deem\nnecessary.
The flames blocking your path have\nbeen fully extinguished. I recommend\nproceeding ahead.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04K\x00\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BI have a status update for you, Master.\nWe are now near the crater at the peak\nof Eldin Volcano.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00I am detecting extremely high\ntemperatures in this area. However,\nyour<y< Fireshield Earrings >>will allow for\nextended periods of exploration.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00I calculate the probability of finding\nthe final<r< sacred flame >>here at 90%.\nI recommend searching for flames.
I am detecting malfunctions within the\nrobot. I recommend repairing it and\ntrying again.
A report, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link.\nI recommend following the <b<Mogma>>'s\nadvice and returning to <r<Lake Floria>>.\n\nI also have some advice pertinent to\nthe situation. It concerns a method\nfor transporting water from the lake...~~~\nI suggest you visit the <r<Water Dragon>>.<pling>\nI conjecture that you can transport\na large volume of water using the <r<water\nbasin>> that the previously injured\nWater Dragon recuperated in.






Would you like me to analyze previous\ndata and register the vessel as a\n<r<dowsing>> target?\n[1]Yes![2-]Not yet.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I have a\nstatus report for you. \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01The flames that\nimpede your progress have not yet been\nextinguished. \nShall I register the <b<Water Dragon>>'s\nvessel as a <g<dowsing >>target?\n[1]Yes![2-]Not yet.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Master, I have completed registering\nthe <b<Water Dragon>>'s vessel as a <g<dowsing\n>>target.<pling>
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x05Understood, Master. I will not proceed\nwith registration.
We have arrived at Eldin Volcano.\n\n\n\nYou can use your <r<dowsing>> ability to\nlocate the gate to the trial. You must\npass this trial in order to locate the\nsacred flame.
Welcome back, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x04Master.\n\n\n\nI conjecture your newly acquired\n<y<Fireshield Earrings >>will allow you to\nsafely travel in extremely hot areas.\n\nI recommend continuing your search\nfor the<r< sacred flame>>.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I detect\nno<r< water >>in the immediate vicinity.\n\n\nOf course, you will need a large basin\nto proceed past the impediment, but\nyou will also need <r<water>>. <pling>I recommend\nyou start with that task.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BA report, Master Link.\nThe transport robot is waiting for you\nat the base of the volcano.\n\nI recommend going up into the sky\nagain and returning to the base of\nthe volcano to guide the robot to\nthis location.
