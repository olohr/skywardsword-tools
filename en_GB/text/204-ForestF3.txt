\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Koro-koo! <pling>I was so shocked when\nwater started flowing out of the\n<r<Great Tree's roots>>!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x05Kwee... How am I supposed to hide\nwhen the whole forest is underwater?\nI hope things go back to normal soon!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01I'll teach you something useful.\nSome rocks will roll away if you\nattack them, kwi-koo!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x07Yeah, the forest's flooded, ka-roo, but\nI'm holding up! Give my best to the\n<b<Water Dragon>>!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x0CWe're finished, kew! What'll become\nof our forest? It's so...wet.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x0CThe <b<Water Dragon>> flooded the forest?\nKew-aroo! She's probably planning to\neat us all when we're soggy!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x0CI don't care if you go dowsing or\ndiving or what, kwi-koo. Just please\nfind those Tadtones!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x09\x0COh, when will this water go away?!\nI can't swim, kik-kwoo!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0FAll this started after the <b<Water Dragon>>\nshowed up, kera-kwoo! This flood must\nbe her fault!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x11\x0BKik-kwee! If you want to know more\nabout Tadtones, you should talk to the\nParella. They know all about them.\n[1]Parella?[2-]I know.
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x07Yeah, the forest's flooded, karoo, but\nI'm holding up! Give my regards to the\n<b<Water Dragon>>!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0C\x01They're those water-dwelling folks with\nthe pointy mouths, kwee-koo!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x0B\x05If you run into one in the water, kweek,\nsee what it has to say!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x04Kee-paleep! I saw the <b<Water Dragon>>!\nShe must be hiding around here\nsomewhere!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x14As you collect Tadtones, kew-kwee,\nyou'll fill in the musical score.\nKeep searching till you find them all!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x14Try dowsing, kwook, and find the\nTadtones!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x14Hurry back to the <b<Water Dragon>>, kwee!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x07Our elder is waiting for you, koo-kew!\nGo and hear what he has to say!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EOh, kewwwwww. You.~~~.~~~.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 You're that one\nfrom before. Come to think of it, I'd\nforgotten to ask your name.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x19I see. \x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, is it?\nNow there's an odd name, kewwwww.\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x00Ah...\n\nWhat brings you to see me?\n[1]This water![2]The woods...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EOh, Link.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x06\x03What's this? The <b<Water Dragon>> caused\nthis flood? So the old girl finally grew\nangry with all the monsters running\nabout the forest, kewwww?\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x0C...The woods won't be getting drier\nanytime soon, kewwww...
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EOff you go, now! Hurry and return to\nthe <b<Water Dragon>>!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x01Kewwww... How nice to see you again,\nLink!\n\n\nHow goes the <b<Tadtone>> gathering?\nI'd actually thought of something\nyou might be interested to know.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x04\x11You see, it's like...hrmm... How\nshould I explain this, kewwww?\n\n\nThere was a technique you used when\nsearching for the others of my tribe,\nremember? That!\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x06\x09Use that thing you do, kewww, and\nyou'll have a much easier time getting\nthose Tadtones!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EYes, yes! That's it! Dowsing! Use your\ndowsing ability, and you'll find the rest\nof those Tadtones in no time flat! ...Or\nis it sharp? Ahem...kewww....
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x02Kewwww, it's good to see you again!\nYes, things look a bit different here,\ndon't they?\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x04\x00The water came gushing out of the <r<base\nof the tree>> behind me<pling> and flooded the\nentire woods.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x03I don't know what caused it,\nbut I suppose it will clear out the\nmonster infestation, kewww, so you\nwon't hear me complaining!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x06\x01All of a sudden water came gushing\nfrom the <r<base of the tree >>and flooded\nthe entire woods, kewwwww.\n\n\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x01\x06But, you know...I rather like it this\nway! Oh ho ho!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EOh, Link! You've\ngathered all the Tadtones, haven't\nyou? That's no small feat! Or should\nI say no small beat, kewwwwww!\nAhem... Anyway, hurry and return to\nthe <b<Water Dragon>>!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EHey, Link! Some nasty\nfish seem to have swum their way into\nthe flooded woods. I'd hate to bump\ninto those things underwater, kewww!\nWatch your toes!
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x0EKewwwwww, Link!\nCan you hear me?\n\n\nI thought up something good! Why\ndon't you come and chat with me for a\nmoment, kewwwwwww?
\x0E\x01\x09\x04\x00\x06If you wish to earn my favor, gather\nthe <r<Tadtones>> and return to me.
You can catch those rogue <b<Tadtones>>\nwith a <g<spin>>! It will pull them toward\nyou so you can grab them.\n\nOh... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EBut I guess you humans <r<use up air\n>>when you do that, so don't go\noverboard!
The pretty bubbles are <r<poisonous>>.\nBe careful! If you breathe one in,\nyou'll <r<choke>>!
Hey, are you collecting Tadtones?\n[1]Yep.[2]Nope.
Oh...sorry.
I'll let you in on a secret, then.\n\n\n\nSome Tadtones hang out in groups.\nYou have to catch those similar\nTadtones <r<one right after the other>> or\nthey'll swim out of your score.\nIf you want to catch a bunch at once,\nuse a <g<spin maneuver>> to <r<draw in>> nearby\nTadtones. That's your best bet.\n\nAside from that...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1Eit's really just a\nmatter of keeping at it!

If you don't collect Tadtones of the\nsame color <r<one right after another>>,\nthey'll wriggle out of your score.\nBut don't work yourself into a panic!
If you make those spiky things <r<explode>>,\nyou're in for a world of hurt. They're\nlike bombs!
Tadtones get along with everybody.\nYou can usually find them where\n<r<other fish are swimming>>.
Hurry back! The <b<Water Dragon >>is\nwaiting!
Those big fish are scary. They charge\nyou for no reason! So testy... I'm glad\nnone of them are around right now.
The <b<ferocious fish>> are baaaaack!\nSWIM FOR YOUR LIFE!\n\n\nThey can't follow you if you dive\n<r<deep>>!
Tadtones store oxygen in their bodies,\nso when you catch one, it will <r<restore\nsome of your air>>.
The Kikwi elder has been looking for\nyou. Why don't you go and hear what he\nhas to say?
The woods have been flooded!
The Water Dragon is furious!
There aren't as many monsters in the\nwoods anymore.
The woods are a lake now!


Signs indicate this is a reference to\nyour <r<dowsing>> ability.\n\n\nIt is a valid suggestion, \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02Master. I am\nfamiliar with the unique aura\nsignatures of Tadtones.
I will calibrate your <pling><r<dowsing>> ability to\nlocate Tadtones. This capability should\nprove to be quite useful in your search.\n\nHowever, please note that you <r<cannot\nuse your dowsing ability underwater>>.

Hey, hey! The current is pretty strong\npast here. If you're heading outside,\nyou better use the exit above!
It's a human!\n\n\n\nThe current is strong beyond this\npoint. It's too swift for a human like\nyou to swim through, so you better\nuse the exit over there.
