\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...Ugh, rough landing.\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00
I think I mighta broke something.\nHey, Link, seriously...\nDidn't anyone ever teach you how to\nland without crash--
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x2CDWHOA!\x0E\x01\x04\x02-\n\n\n\nB-birds? TINY birds?! Wh-what...\nARE they?!
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDAnd what is that thing?!
But...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\nhow...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n Wh-why\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n...\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x2CDWha-what...\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDWhere am I?!

\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x4CDWhat's going on here? Ever since Zelda\nvanished, you've been zipping in and\nout of town all in a hurry!\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x4CDSo I figured I'd tail you, and you might\nlead me to Zelda.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x3CDBut this is...so wild. Seriously, what IS\nthat thing over there?!
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x3CDAnd what's with all these trees?\nThere are so many!
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x3CDJust give it to me straight! I can take it.\nWhere are we? Is Zelda here?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\x3CDWhat's the deal with this place?!\nIf there's supposed to be nothin'\nbelow the clouds, what's all this?
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDUhhhh~~~... Whoa...~~~ You're kind of\nimploding my mind right now...\nBut I think I get what you're saying.\n\nIf I've got this right, Zelda is down\nhere somewhere, and she's...OK?
She's... She's OK. Oh, wow! That's\nso great! Duh huh huh...
Hearing that is such a...huge\nweight off my mind.
You know, Link...\nIt's sort of all right down here.
This place needs a name.\x0E\x01\x04\x02< Yeah...\nA name fitting for this rugged,\nadventurous wilderness. From now on,\nwe'll call it...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E \x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CD\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD<r<Grooseland>>~~~!


The harp you hold is known as the\n<y<Goddess's Harp>>. It is a divine\ninstrument of the goddess who once \nwatched over this land.
The melodies it brings to life have the \npower to produce a variety of strange\nand otherworldly effects.
The great slab standing before you is \nknown as a <b<Gate of Time>>.\n\n\nIt is the last of its kind in existence...\nThe only portal binding our world to\nthe one where Zelda now resides.
If you manage to open the gate and \npass through, you will likely end up in \nthe same place as Zelda.\n\nBut you will need to endure many\nhardships and put yourself in great\ndanger to awaken the gate from its \ndormant state.\nThough your journey will put you in \nharm's way, Link...\nYou must endure. It is your fate as the\nchosen hero of the godde--
This shaking... I fear the seal has\nbeen broken.\n\n\nI expected that it would react to your\nsummoning the gate, but I never\nimagined the seal would break so\nquickly.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, there will be time to\nexplain later. Right now, you must \nhurry to the bottom of the pit outside. 

Nice going, Link.
Though the Imprisoned had only just\nbegun to awaken and break its bonds,\nI'm impressed you were able to restore\nthe seal keeping it captive.\nUnfortunately, you have only\nsucceeded in buying us a little more\ntime in which to act.
The behemoth you beat back into\nconfinement is a horror of unspeakable\npower.\n\nJudging by what I saw, I would not be\nsurprised if the seal gave way again\nsoon.
So you are left with precious little time\nto complete the task with which you\nhave been entrusted.\n\nReturn to the Sealed Temple,\nLink. There is much to\ndiscuss.

...As you can see, the gate is nothing\nmore than a slab of cold stone for now.\nIt is sleeping.\n\nRousing it from its slumber would \nrequire great power.\n\n\nYes, I believe a shot of holy light from\nyour <r<Skyward Strike>> might just do it...
Ah, sorry to disappoint you, boy, but\nfor now your sword lacks the power\nnecessary to awaken the gate.\n\nFirst, you and your sword must grow\ntogether.
<r<Faron Woods>>...<r<Eldin Volcano>>...\nand <r<Lanayru Desert>>...\n\n\nA <r<sacred flame >>is hidden somewhere\nin each of these lands. Seek them out,\nand purify your sword in their heat.\n\nOnly after your blade has been\ntempered by these three fires will it be\nfully imbued with the <r<great power >>for\nwhich you search.
Clues to finding the sacred flames \nhave been woven into the lyrics of a \nsong precious to your people,\nthe <r<Ballad of the Goddess>><pling>.\nThese clues are your best hope of\nfinding your way to the flames.\n\n\nReturn to <b<Skyloft>>. Somewhere on your\nisland is one whose <r<knowledge >>of this\nold song will point you in the right\ndirection.
I hate even sayin' this, but I guess you\ngot it all figured out, Grannie.\n\n\nMe, well, there's nothin' I can do to\nhelp <b<Zelda>>. I'm useless.
Ah. You sell yourself short, my friend.\nYou'll see in time that you have your\nown role to play in all this.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, go now.\nTrust in fate to guide your feet. \nYour mission depends on it...as does\nZelda's fate.

Do not fear it. This is what we have\nwaited for. At long last, the gate has\nbeen reactivated.
Standing before you is a path that\ntranscends the flow of time. It is a\nportal to the past...to the very place\nwhere <b<Zelda >>now waits.
Go bravely, Link.\nIf everything is as I suspect, the\nreunion with Zelda you've fought so \nhard for lies beyond this gate. 
Nah, don't worry about me.\nI'm gonna hang back here,\nLink.
That stupid monster doesn't know when\nto quit, and Grannie here keeps\nyapping on and on about how we never\nknow when it might bust free again.
Someone's gotta stick around and\nguard the place. Might as well be me.
Besides, if I'm not here, who's gonna\nlook out for the old girl?
\x0E\x01\x05\x047\x00And you know what...
Naw, forget about it...\x0E\x01\x05\x04\x00 
When you see Zelda, tell her I said\n\x201CWhat's up?\"

You've come so far,\nLink...\nI'm glad you made it.
I imagine Impa filled you in on\neverything. We've traveled very far\nfrom home...to the distant past.\n\nIn this era, the wounds inflicted on the\nland during the battle between the\ngoddess and the demon king known as\n<b<Demise>> have not yet healed.\nAll the fairy tales about that war we\nheard growing up in Skyloft... \nIncredible as it may seem, they appear\nto be all too real.
I think it's time you learned the whole\nstory. Let me try to explain...
The old gods created a <r<supreme power\n>>that gave anyone who possessed it the\nability to shape reality and fulfill any\ndesire. They called it\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E <y+<the Triforce>>.\nIn his thirst to make the world his own,\n<b<Demise>> readied a massive army of\nmonsters for war. He sought to take the\nTriforce for himself by force.\nThe goddess feared for her people.\nShe used her power to send both them\nand the Triforce into the sky on a slice\nof earth she cut away from the land.\nThis floating rock became the new\nhome of our people. In time, it came\nto be known as <r<Skyloft>>.
After a long and fierce battle, the\n<b<goddess Hylia>> succeeded in sealing\naway Demise.\n\nHowever, soon after the demon king\nwas imprisoned, it became clear that\nthe seal would not hold long against\nhis fearsome power.\nHylia had suffered grave injuries in\nher battle with the demon king.\nShe knew that if he broke free again,\nthere would be no stopping him.
And if the demon king were to free\nhimself, it would mean the <r<end of the\nworld >>for all beings of this land.\n\nIn order to put an end to the demon\nking, Hylia devised two separate plans\nand set them both into motion.
First, she created <b<Fi>>. She made the\nspirit that resides in your sword to\nserve a single purpose: to assist her\n<r<chosen hero>> on his mission.\nHer second plan...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1Ewas to abandon her\ndivine form and transfer her soul to\nthe body of a mortal.
...~~~She made this sacrifice, as you have\nlikely guessed, so that the <r<supreme\npower created by the old gods >>could\none day be used.\nFor while the <r<supreme power >>of the\n<y+<Triforce >>was created by gods, all of its\npower can never be wielded by one.\n\nKnowing this power was her last and\nonly hope, the goddess gave up her\n<r<divine powers>> and her <r<immortal form>>.
You've probably figured it out by now,\nhaven't you, Link?\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDYou are the <r<chosen hero>>,\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 and I, <b<Zelda>>...\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI am the<r< goddess reborn as a mortal>>.
The day of the ceremony, Ghirahim's\ntornado tossed me out of the sky and\ndown to the world below.\n\nI was nearly captured by the demonic\nforces, but I was rescued at the last\nmoment by the old woman who lives\nin the Sealed Grounds.
I had no memory at all of my existence\nas Hylia, but she explained it to me.\nShe helped me to remember who I\nwas\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Íand what I had to do.\nI set out to pray at the goddess statues\nlocated in each temple across the land.\n\n\nEach statue stirred up memories within\nme. After I visited them all, <b<Impa>>,\nan <r<agent of the goddess>>, led me\nhere...to the past.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFDCD...~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDAll of this is part of the same great\neffort to prevent the revival of Demise.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14
Stripped of his true physical form by \nthe seal that binds him, he takes the \nshape of an abomination.\n\nBut even in his hideous state, he's more\nthan capable of devouring this land if \nwe allow him to do what he desires.
We must stop him from freeing himself\nfrom the seal that imprisons him.\nAt any cost...\n\nThat is why I intend to remain here in \nthis time and place... To sustain the \nseal as best as I can.\n\nAs long as I continue this vigil, we may\nbe able to prevent the demon king from\nfully reviving himself in our own time. 
I must maintain the seal that Hylia--~~~\nrather, that I--created so long ago and\nkeep it strong for as long as I am able.\n\nWith the memories of my former life\nreturning to me, I can see now that this\nis my purpose.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, the goddess created\nFi and the great blade she's a part of\nfor very specific reasons.\n\nFor the task of standing against <r<Demise>>\nin the <r<monstrous form >>he now assumes\nrests solely on your shoulders.\n\nBack in our own time, you've already\ndriven him back into his prison twice\nnow. I can't thank you enough for\nthat, Link.
During your long journey, you've\ngrown so much.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDYou learned <r<wisdom >>from solving\ndevious puzzles and traps. \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14You gained\n<r<power>> by honing and tempering both\nyourself and your sword.\nAnd by overcoming the trials set\nbefore you by the goddess, you've\nfound true <r<courage>>.\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍNow that those qualities reside in you,\nyou are worthy of wielding the power\nthe old gods left behind for our kind.\nYou can claim the <y+<Triforce>>.
<y+<Valiant <r<hero<y+<, you have endured many\nhardships and journeyed far in your\nquest to reach this place.\n\n<y+<Along your travels you have found\nwisdom, power, and courage, and for\nthis I shall bless your sword with the\ngoddess's power.<y+<\n<y+<May it give you and your sword the\nstrength to drive back the abomination\nthat threatens this land!<y+<>>
The mark you see upon the back of your\nhand is proof that you are the hero of\nlegend and that within you dwells\nsacred power.\nIt is the mark of the <y+<Triforce>>.\n\n\n\nStand now, Link.\nDraw your sword.
The goddess has blessed your blade, and\nthe Master Sword has at last achieved its\nultimate form!\n\nThe sword is now imbued with the mythical\npower to drive back demons, and only\n<b<Link >>may wield it!
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, before I say another\nword, I feel like I owe you an apology.\n\n\nYou see, the <y+<mark of the Triforce >>on\nyour hand is a symbol of the greatest\npower in this world.
If you can obtain the actual Triforce,\nwe will have the power to vanquish\nDemise once and for all.\n\nThe problem is, among the countless\nsouls in this world, only a select few--\nthose with an<r< unbreakable spirit>>--\ncan wield its might.
It's impossible to know the true reason\nwhy the old gods created the Triforce.~~~\nBut I have a theory of my own.\n\nThe gods created the Triforce, yet they\nspecifically designed it so that their\nown kind could never use its power.\n\nSomehow, I think that may have been\ntheir way of giving hope to all the\nmortal beings of the land.\n\n...Which brings us back to ~~~you.\n\n\n\nTo face Demise and bring hope back to\nthe land, the goddess Hylia needed\nsomeone with an unbreakable spirit.\nThat is you, Link.
But spirit alone wasn't enough.\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EYou had to overcome many trials and\n<r<awaken the hero within yourself >>so that\nyou could <r<wield that supreme power>>.\nAnd so Hylia...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 I mean, and so I...\x0E\x01\x04\x02-\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI knew that if it meant saving Zelda,\nyou would throw yourself headfirst\ninto any danger, without even a\nmoment's doubt...\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI...\x0E\x01\x04\x02- I used you.\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í
\x0E\x03\x01\x00...Link, I can't begin to\ntell you how sorry I am for pulling\nyou into all of this.\n\nBut you have to understand this is a\nwar, and the fate of the land hangs in\nthe balance. I need your strength to tip\nthe scales in our favor...
All that may be well intentioned and\ntrue, but it doesn't mean it's right...\nand it doesn't excuse my actions.\n\nBut I'm prepared to pay the price for\nwhat I've done.
To ensure that the seal holds, I will\nremain here in this time...deep in sleep\nfor thousands of years.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link...I can't say it\nenough. I'm so sorry for the way I had\nto involve you in this.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDBut until my memory of things before\nour lifetime returned to me, I had no\nidea we were fated to carry such a\nheavy destiny.\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDBefore all this, I was happy just\nspending my days hanging around with\nyou in Skyloft. I wanted that feeling to\nlast ~~~forever.\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í
While it's true that I am Hylia reborn,\nI'm still my father's daughter\x0E\x01\x04\x02\n and\nyour friend...\n\nI'm still your Zelda.
When Demise is finally gone, there will\nbe no more need for the seal that binds\nhim, and then I'll be able to wake up.\n\nSo I'm going to ask you a favor,\nsleepyhead. Ever since we were kids,\nI'd always be the one to wake you up\nwhen you slept in.\nBut this time, when all of this is over,\nwill you come to wake me up?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E \n[1]I promise.[2]I will.[3]Of course!

\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x0BMaster Link, I bring\nnews. I have confirmed that the Isle of\nthe Goddess, which was formerly a part\nof <b<Skyloft>>, has returned to the surface.
Furthermore, I have detected the\nsuccessful eradication of <b<Demise>>.\nYour prayers to the <y+<Triforce>> have\nbeen heard.
In light of these factors, the seal Zelda\nmaintained through her agelong sleep\nis no longer necessary. My projections\nindicate she will wake momentarily.
I advise you to make your way to the \nSealed Temple as soon as possible.


\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDGood morning...Link...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í\x0E\x01\x05\x04x\x00

This is all very touching, really, but I'm\nafraid I have to cut this emotional\nmoment short.
It's best for everyone if you forget\nabout your friend. The little <b<goddess>> is\nmine now! 
My master may have perished in this\nage, but in the past he lives yet!\nI'm taking the girl back through that\ngate to help me revive the <b<demon king>>!
You've been so adorably dogged in your\nquest to get in my way, and as much as\nit has delighted me, I can no longer\ntolerate you nipping at my heels.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...Link...
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDStand down.~~~ You're in my way~~~, and\nthe sight of your appalling hair makes\nmy gorge rise.~~~
You've done a fine job of spoiling my\nplans to revive the demon king in this\nage, so I see no point in dawdling here.
But the past...oh, the past... So full of\npossibilities. I shall resurrect him\nthere with the divine soul of this \ngolden-haired girl!
...You know, boy, you've really pushed\nme too far. The moment I sweated and\nbled for is at hand.\n\nI don't even have the time to grind my\nheel into a worm like you. Not now.

Hear me, my hordes! The spell will soon\nbe complete!~~~ The demon king returns!~~~\nUntil then, you WILL keep that whelp\nfrom interfering with my ritual.
I don't care if the whole lot of you get\nlodged on the end of his blade. You will\nbuy me the time I need! Do not fear\nhim... Fear my wrath if you fail me!\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00

You're far too quick, boy!
I realize a simple child like you knows\nnothing of magic, but spells like this\ntake time and a steady hand! Can't you\nwait quietly like a good boy? HMM?\nYou petulant brat... You've pushed me\ntoo far. I've waited my whole existence\nfor this! This is my moment!
You know what? Fine! If you're so \nintent on hurrying to your grave, I'll be\nhappy to show you the way!\x0E\x01\x05\x04Z\x00
This time there will be no heroic\nescape. I was a fool to toy with you and\nlet you walk away with your life before,\nbut I won't make that mistake again.
\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDThat, I promise!\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00
If only I'd put you in your place from\nthe very beginning. Show a human a\nlittle mercy and next thing you know,\nhe thinks himself your equal!\nGiven my station, I had to maintain\nsome semblance of dignity, so I let you\nrun with your life... Twice, even.\nSuch a guilty pleasure...\nBut instead of scurrying away like any\ncreature with a basic instinct to\nsurvive, you just kept coming back.\nAgain...and again...and again.
I've let a mere boy make a fool of me\nfor the last time. You stand before a\ndemon...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1Eor should I say, a <r<weapon\n>>without mercy!\x0E\x01\x04\x02Z 
For you, boy, I've prepared a most\nappropriate and humiliating death.\nI even have a pet name for it--I call it\nthe <r<endless plunge>>!\nFirst, I will take my time bludgeoning\nyou, and when I grow bored of it, I will\n<r<drive you to the edge>> and deliver a last\nstrike to send you <r<falling to your doom>>!\nI'll delight in casting your body into\nthis pit and snuffing out the flame of\nyour life! Your broken body will serve\nas fine sustenance for the demon king!

This... This is preposterous.\nDriven to my knees by a simple child\nof man. Laughable!\n\nNo matter how many times we clash,\nI can't prevail! You think I can't\ndefeat you? You think I can't win??\n\nBoy...what are you?


Ah... But never mind that. Victory is\nstill mine to savor. While we fought,\nthe ritual I started continued....\n\nAt last, it's complete! The demon king\nshall devour the soul of the goddess and\nresurrect in his full glory!
Don't you see? It's all over! You and\nyour kind have lost! This world and\neverything in it now belong to\ndarkness!\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E They belong to my master!

\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDWelcome back to us,\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E <b<Master>>.\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍSo you are the chosen knight of\nthe <b<goddess>>.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDIntriguing...\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í
The goddess lowered herself to a\nmortal existence to keep me\nimprisoned.\n\nHow pathetic. This bag of flesh pales\nin comparison to the magnificence of\nher previous form.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04P\x00\x0E\x01\x08\x02\x1CDDon't worry, Link!\nGroose has got this!
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, I... \x0E\x01\x04\x02\nI caught her!\nShe's OK!
Hmm... So you and that other human\nwould stand before obliteration to aid\nthe goddess, would you?
How curious... The humans I've known\nwere weak things. Hardly more than\ninsects, shivering under rocks and\nready to flee at a mere glimpse of me.
When last I walked this world, they did\nlittle more than scream and cling to\ntheir goddess, mewling and praying...\nCounting on her to protect them.\nHow amusing to think those cowards\nbegot someone like you.
You grow more fascinating by the\nsecond, human. I never imagined I'd\nmeet one of your kind who wished to\nstand against me in battle.
Very well, then. I shall prepare a place\nfor us where we will not be bothered\nby distractions. If you still have the\ncourage to face me, seek me there.
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, we're counting on\nyou! Oh, and Grannie had some info\nfor you.
The old girl says it'll take time for that\ngrease wad to absorb Zelda's soul\ncompletely!
If you can take him down before her\nsoul gets all sucked up into that...\nthing, you might still have a chance!
I...I know you can do it!
So...yeah! You've gotta do this! \nYou're all Zelda's got! You've got to \nmake this happen!
If you fear for your life, do not follow\nme.~~~ You can spend what little time\nyour world has left cowering and\ncrying, as befits your kind.\nBut if you truly desire to raise your\nblade against the world I would build,\ncome for me.\n\nI've waited eons to return. I can spare a\nfew more moments to let you decide.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDIt's up to you now,\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 Link...

Ah, so you've decided to meet your end\nin battle after all. It pleases me greatly\nto see such misplaced valor, human.
Take a moment to appreciate your\nsurroundings, for where we stand\nshall serve as your tomb for eternity.
\x0E\x01\x05\x04F\x00The hate for the gods that has boiled\nin my veins...
You will taste all of it in the bite of\nmy blade.
The only question left is how long you\nwill manage to remain standing before\nI take your life.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E Try to keep it \ninteresting for me, would you?
And when you do fall, know that your\nworld and everything in it is mine to\ndominate... Mine to subjugate...\nMine to rule!
When I finish with you, you can take\nsolace in knowing your friends and kin\nwill soon follow, as I wipe all who\noppose me from the face of this world!
...It won't be long now. At last, the\nalmighty power I've sought for\nmillennia...
I will take the <y+<Triforce>> for my own...
\x0E\x01\x05\x04<\x00And the world shall be under my foot\nfor eternity!


\x0E\x01\x05\x04o\x00Extraordinary. You stand as a paragon\nof your kind, human.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x05\x04j\x00You fight like no man or demon I have\never known. ~~Though this is not the end.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x05\x04[\x00My hate...~~never perishes. ~~It is born\nanew in a cycle with no end!\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x05\x04[\x00I will rise again!
\x0E\x01\x05\x04Ü\x00Those like you... Those who share the\nblood of the goddess and the spirit of\nthe hero... They are eternally bound to\nthis curse.\n\x0E\x01\x05\x04Ü\x00An <b<incarnation >>of my hatred shall\never follow your kind, dooming them to\nwander a blood-soaked sea of darkness\nfor all time!
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x12I have confirmed the eradication of the\ndemon king.\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1EHis residual consciousness has been\nabsorbed into the <y<Master Sword>>...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD\nand is now <r<sealed away>>.

You have done well, Link.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCD~~~\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E Thank you.\nI think it's over...~~~ Finally...it's all over.
Nice going, you two. You guys were\ntotally amazing in this little adventure\nI like to call the <r<Legend of Groose>>.
...That's a little joke.
Joke or not, your contributions to our\nefforts were heroic. You have my\nthanks.
Aww, well, you know... Just glad I could\nmake myself useful. I'm happy things \nturned out OK.
Hey, so things look pretty sewn up\nhere. What do you say, guys? \nReady to head back to our own time?
Grannie was really worried about you\ntwo. We don't want to keep the old girl\nin suspense too long.
Hylia, Your Grace...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 Or perhaps you\nprefer \x201CZelda.\" It pleases me to know\nyou are safe.\n\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECD...~~~\x0E\x01\x06\x02ÍMaster, I must speak with you.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master Link, you have\nsuccessfully protected the goddess\nreborn and defeated Demise, fulfilling\nyour role as the <r<hero>> of legend.\nMy purpose here is complete.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I ask you to dissolve our\narrangement as master and servant.
Drive the sword into the pedestal\nbefore you, and I will return to the\nsword to enter a sleep without end.
\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x01Master, you have achieved the purpose\nyou were chosen to fulfill. Please, set\nthe sword in the pedestal and bring the\ngoddess's mission to an end.
Now,\x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x02 Master. It is time to conclude our\nnecessary companionship.
Link...
\x0E\x03\x01\x00Link, hear me.\nMy purpose was to obey the command\nof the goddess and lead you, the chosen\nhero of this land, on your quest.\nWhen I first awoke and began this task,\nI perceived it as merely serving my\nfunction as a servant to Her Grace.\n\nHowever, I have come to consider the\ninformation corresponding to our\ntime together among the most precious\ndata I have on record.
I do not have the capability to fully\nunderstand the human spirit,\nLink...\n\nBut now, at the end of my journey with\nyou, as I prepare to sleep within the\nMaster Sword forever, I experience a\nfeeling I am unable to identify.\nI lack sufficient data to be sure of my\nconclusion, but I believe this feeling\ncorrelates closest to what your people\ncall...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1Ehappiness.
Our partnership is at an end, and even\nas we speak, I feel my consciousness\nfading away.\n\nBefore I enter the sleep that calls me\nto the sword, I wish to relay to you\nwords that I recorded many times over\nthe course of our journey.\nMany have said them to you thus far,\nbut I now wish to say them for myself...
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFDCDThank you,\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E \x0E\x01\x12\x04\x00\x11Master Link.\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\nMay we meet again in another life...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E
What? Impa, why? Come with us!
Zelda, Your Grace, you possess the\nmemories of the goddess. You must\nunderstand why that is not possible.\n\nI am a being of this age.\nMy place is here.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDI...~~~ I know that, but...
You must return to your own time.\nI will take care of the gate once you\nhave passed through.
I...can't do that. You and I have been\nthrough so much together. I don't want\nto leave you alone.
Please, Impa. Come back with us.
Zelda, at the command of the goddess,\nI passed through the Gate of Time. \nI did so to protect you and aid the fight\nto prevent the world's destruction.\nThe last remnants of <b<Demise>> are \ndecaying slowly within the sword.\nSomeone must stay behind to watch\nover this blade.\nHis spirit must not reawaken.\nHe must never be allowed to threaten\nthe world again.

This is the nature of the task given to\nmy tribe.\n\n\nAs a member of the <b<Sheikah>>, the\ngoddess's chosen guardians, I gladly\nwelcome this duty.
Zelda, I shall watch over the <y+<Triforce>>.\n\n\n\n<y+<\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDIts power is too great to leave in the\ngrasp of man. Dependence on its might\nis an invitation to disaster.\n\n>><y+<\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDWhen it has served its purpose, it must\nbe secreted away to lay dormant once\nagain...the knowledge of its existence\nhidden from mortal history.<y+<\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í<y+<\n>>These are the words the goddess spoke\nto me long ago. I remember them well.\nAs do you, I'm sure.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDDo not despair, Zelda. You and I will\nsurely meet again someday. 

\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFCCD...See?\x0E\x01\x04\x02- \x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDI told you we'd meet again.

\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDImpa...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14 Thank you.\n\n\n\n\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDThank you for everything.\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í

\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDLook around us! As a child, I always\ndreamed of a world below. I wanted to \nsee the surface with my own eyes~~~ and\nfeel the land's warm breeze on my skin.~~~\n\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFFCDI...\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E I think I want to live here. \x0E\x01\x04\x02\x14\nI always want to feel solid ground \nbeneath my feet~~~, see the clouds above\nmy head,\x0E\x01\x06\x02Í and watch over the <y+<Triforce>>.
\x0E\x01\x06\x02\xFECDWhat about you, Link?\x0E\x01\x04\x02\x1E\nWhat will you do now?
